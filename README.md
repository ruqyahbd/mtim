Alḥamdulillāh, we have managed to recover and organize many of Ustadh Muhammad Tim Humble’s lectures and notes, especially those previously available on his websites:

- mohammadtim.com ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240518103905/https://muhammadtim.com/))  
- note.mohammadtim.com ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20241110023855/https://notes.muhammadtim.com/))

As these websites have been offline for quite some time, many of us have deeply felt the absence of their valuable content. This repository was created to serve as a centralized archive of what could be retrieved from available public resources, including lectures, notes, and Ruqyah-related advice. which includes:

- Ruqyah guidelines
- Jinn & Magic related articles
- Spiritual advice
- Personal reflections and da’wah notes
- Notes from one-day/two-day Ruqyah seminars
- Lecture transcriptions
- Articles for new Muslims and non-Muslims

📚 The intention is to preserve these beneficial works for ourselves and others, especially those involved in Ruqyah, da’wah, or seeking knowledge on spiritual ailments.
