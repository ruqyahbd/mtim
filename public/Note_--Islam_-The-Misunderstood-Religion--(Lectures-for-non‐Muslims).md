# Islam: The Misunderstood Religion (Sunderland Uni) Lecture fo Non Muslims
<sup>Version 1.0</sup>


I'd like to begin as we always begin, with the praise of Almighty God, and by sending salutations upon all of his prophets and messengers; upon Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, may the peace and blessings of Almighty God be upon them all.

I would like to start by thanking God for making it possible for us to gather here today, as well as thanking the brothers and sisters from the Islamic society who organized this event,
which is very important to help us understand each other and overcome the barriers that exist, the [EDL protest] outside being enough of an evidence for the need for these kind of events.

I would also like to thank all of you for coming and giving up your time to listen to me talk today about the misunderstood religion.

What this is about (Misconceptions)
Essentially what I want to talk about are the misconceptions that people have about Islam. Traditionally I would begin by explaining what Islam is, but today I'm not going to do that. 
Today I'm going to go through the misconceptions that people have about Islam and then talk about what Islam really is removing those misconceptions and misunderstandings. 

Introduction
I'd like to begin by introducing myself very briefly for those of you who don't know me. My name is Timothy Michael Hummel, my mother called me Tim. 
I commonly go by the name Mohamed since I became a Muslim at the age of 14 and I've been Muslim for 16 years and I studied Islam both in the UK and abroad.  
I came back and my daily job involves teaching Islam to Muslims and non-Muslims, establishing dialogue and communication and removing misconceptions. 
About guided media and other places where common questions regarding Islam are asked
There is a project which is called Guided Media, their domain name is guided.com. 
The website that I particularly want to draw your attention to, that I think you guys would benefit from is the website talktoIslam.com. 
It's a website that is built upon questions that most non-Muslims ask about Islam.  For example, why do Muslims not eat pork, 
why don't Muslims not drink alcohol, why don't Muslim men not shake hands with Muslim women, why don't Muslim women shake hands with Muslim me, 
why do Muslim women cover their hair, all questions that are very commonly asked on a daily basis, 
data-mined from the most common questions that people ask on Google. This website is a website , full of resources that you can use, talktoIslam.com. 
Please do have a read of what's on there, there is always new material coming up on the site and some of the material that 
we're going to talk about today is going to be based upon the answers that were given.
Islam misunderstood
Now, I do think that Islam is genuinely a misunderstood religion.
 I'm going to talk about different misconceptions. 
Some of them are going to be extremely serious, very theological, what do Muslims believe about god, some of them social misconceptions, 
like forced marriage and we might talk about those that are less serious, like the funny ones to lighten the mood up a bit and give a mix of material here today. 

### Muslim and Islam
The first thing that I want to explain to you, is the difference between a Muslim and Islam. It's very subtle but very important. 
Islam is a religion and as a religion it has a scripture it has a prophet, rules and regulation. A Muslim is a person, there are many Muslims in this room here today and I'm one of them. 
As a human being I get things right and wrong, I slip up in various things, I make errors, so as a Muslim, am I representative of Islam absolutely? 
No. The only thing that represents Islam is Islamic scripture. 
As for Muslims they are human beings who choose to implement a certain amount of Islam, to a greater and lesser extend according to their own free choice. 
Islam is a religion which does not advocate compulsion, it does not hold that people are to be compelled to do things, 
except those things that are for the greater benefit of the society, as for the individual actions it is up to the individual. 
This is especially true in the United Kingdom, because we live in a free and democratic society where people are not forced to do anything  and are free to say what they want, and practice whatever religion they want.

 Every Muslim in the UK is going to apply Islam to a greater or a lesser degree according to their personal circumstances and according to their desires and their ends out of life. 
Some people are very devout, practicing and traditional, some people are less so, some have a Muslim name and come from a Muslim ethnicity, but they don't identify with Islam at all. 
I have a neighbor who I honestly did not know he was Muslim for a very long time. I didn't see anything from him that would make me think he is a Muslim at all. 
There are Muslims who have funny ideas, cultural problems and cultural baggage and this is something that you can see here today in the UK 
and you can see it from the fact that when new cultures come, people absorb culture of the people they live with. 
In the Muslim world there are a lot of countries where there are more than one religion. In fact there are very few countries in which the only known religion is Islam. 
You have Islam with Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, sexism, Buddhism and this means there have been fusions of cultures. 
Forced marriage
There are cultural practices that have nothing to do with Islam at all. One of them we're going to talk about is forced marriage. 
This is a cultural practice which takes place in some Muslim countries, which has nothing to do with Islam, and Islam specifically prohibits and speaks against it. 

**Are there Muslims that force their daughters into marriage? **
Yes. I would be lying if I would tell you otherwise. 
I would suggest to you that there are also Christians and Jews and Hindus and Seeks who do exactly the same, because it is a cultural and not a religious practice. 
For example if we look at south east Asia, it is common across all social and religious groups.
We're going to judge Islam by the scripture. If it says it's right or wrong, we can talk about that. 
As for whether or not this or that Muslim implements what they are supposed to then I think all of you understand 
that there are many people of different faiths who implement their religion to a greater or lesser degree. 
My point is, don't judge Islam by what Muslims do, judge Islam by what the scripture says.
I want to begin about the religious misunderstandings, not social issues but the pure concept of god, for Muslims. 

### About Allah and different iterations
While I was doing my research for this seminar, I came across a number of things that are said about the Islamic concept of god. 
The first is people from a Judeo-Christian background who say Muslims worship a different god. 
Now I think most of you know, that Muslims call god Allah and the misconception that many people have is that Allah is a different god to the god Moses, Noah or Abraham. 
Some people thought that Allah is a representation of a moon god, some people talk about the fact that the name is different and that it is the god of the pagan Arabs. 

In Islam we have a number of things that we can show you why this is a misconception. First is the linguistic meaning of the word Allah, 
which comes from the base of the Arabic word [...] which means god. And so Allah is the one true god, the word means the one true god, the only god. 
The word [...] is something that is worshiped. 
Allah comes from that word, meaning the only god that deserves to be worshiped. It has an extra emphasis on the fact that it is the one almighty supreme god. 
For example you can't make the word Allah feminine, it doesn't have a feminine form. You can't make the word Allah plural. 
It's a word that is absolutely singular, and has no feminine form, nor does it have an associated gender. It's masculine in form 
and that's because in the Arabic language it is used that way, but Allah is neither male, nor female, because these are attributes of the creations not the creator. 
Then we look at it from the point of view of what the Quran says. We see that whenever it mentions the word Allah, and does not describe it as the gods the pagans used to worship. 
It describes Allah as the god of the bible and as the god of the creator of the prophets and the heavens and the earth. There is yet another point. 
Arabic speaking Jews and Christians also use the word Allah for god. If you were to go into a church in [...] and the service was in Arabic the minister would say Allah who is in heaven. 
In every Arabic speaking country, Egypt, Morocco, Syria, Lebanon all of the countries that have mix of Christian and Muslim faiths, 
likewise the Arabic speaking Jews, they also refer to Allah as Allah. If we look at Aramaic, which was the language that Jesus spoke, 
you may be surprised to learn that the name of god is almost identical to the word Allah. 
That would suggest to us historically that Jesus called god Allah or something very close. Hopefully we've clarified that the Muslims do not worship a different god, 
but it's the same god that the Christians say when they call upon him as our lord the father. 
Someone might say, you know, you Muslims make things difficult for people. Why didn't you just say god?
 Why do Muslims love to use the word Allah and not the word god. First of all because it comes into the Quran, which is sacred. 
Secondly there is something special about the word Allah, that it can't be misconstrued. Imagine I have a gathering of people of the Hindu faith. 
If I say to them, you and me what do you think about god, what do I think about god. It's likely if I say the word god, they understand god in their concept of god, 
likewise if I ask a Christian they are going to answer me with their concept of god. The word god can be applied to many religions and many concepts of god, 
all religious explanations of the word god. When I say Allah in general, nobody has any doubt, even if the Christians use the word Allah they use it for the god in heaven, and not to Jesus. 
The word Allah is unique and easy for people to understand what I'm referring to. I'm not referring to any other concept of got
 other than the Muslim concept of god and that's why Muslims like to use the word Allah. Of course we try to explain what it means.
Worshiping misconceptions
From the misconceptions that I think I found to be the most common misconceptions about Islam, is that Muslims worship Mohammed or in other variations, that Muslims worship the [...]
I have a theory behind why this is. Most of the people who have the impression who have the impression that Muslims worship Mohamed, 
they are simply comparing Islam to Christianity. I had a discussion with my grand-mother. We were talking about Islam and she said, 
You guys worship Mohamed, like we worship Jesus. 
And I said no, Islam is the opposite of that.
 Islam is the only absolutely monotheistic religion, the only religion that has absolute monotheism at its core. 
Monotheism that takes it to such a level, that the worst crime is to make a partner with almighty god. And the only unforgivable sin is for you to give the rights of god to somebody else. 
If you're not allowed to give it to Mohamed, Jesus, Gabriel, peace be upon them all, then you're not allowed to give them to anybody. 
That's how a person becomes Muslim [...]  That's how they go from not being Muslim to being Muslim by pronouncing these words,
 by saying there is nothing deserving of worship except god alone. The concept for a Muslim to worship Mohamed, peace be upon him and all the messengers, 
is as alien in Islam as a Muslim worshiping, Jesus and anything other than god. Why is it then, that we see these Muslims bowing down before the black building. 

### Prayer Direction
The [...] is a prayer direction and it's not an intention to pray to it. It's actually a regular building, you can go inside, of it. It used to have two doors,
 it was a regular place of prayer, of worship. They closed off one of the door so that they can control who comes in an out and it has remained like this today. 
If you happen to have an invitation you can go in and pray. For Muslim it's a prayer direction. There is some evidence that many religions had a prayer direction. 
There is some evidence that many religions had prayer directions. The Jews and the Christians, both faced Jerusalem in their prayers. 
They would face their holy land in their prayers. Jerusalem was the place that they were commanded to face and Islam is a continuation of the revelation of Moses and Jesus, 
peace be upon them both. If the people of Moses and Jesus faced Jerusalem then the Muslims did the same.
 Later it was revealed for the Muslims to change and to turn their direction towards [...] used as a direction of prayer. 
We believe it to be a holy place, but it certainly isn't worshiped. So when you see people bowing towards it they are bowing down to god. 
It think there are some satellite channels where people can see people praying in [...] I would recommend our non Muslim guests to see them pray. 
You will see everybody facing one way and all of the bowing, standing, prostrating and sitting up in unison.  
This is a sign of the unity and the common purpose of Islam to worship god.

### Differences and similarities between Islam Christianity and Judaism
One of the next misconceptions that I want to deal with is the issue that Islam is a new and completely separate religion from Christianity and Judaism. 
I want to deal with this alongside a the misconception that there is no difference between them. We're told in the Quran that the prophet Mohamed, 
peace be upon him, is told to say: I'm not something new among the messengers. 
What is meant by that is that I didn't come with anything different to that which Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus came with. 
The laws of diffenret groups and differnet religions, the authentic religions, the laws from people to people changed. 
So we know that when Jesus came, he abolished some of those laws. Christianity does not see itself as a completely new religion, 
rather as the continuation of the old testament, with the continuation of Jesus' teachings in the new testament. 
I'm giving you an idea that Christianity is not a brand new religion. Jesus did change things but the basic laws remained. 
He preached a continuation of the law of Moses with some changes. The prophet Mohamed simply continued the previous teachings with some changes.
 Islam affirms the truth of the previous prophets.
However we should be careful to explain the second misconception, that there is no difference between Islam and Christianity. 
I delivered recently in Lincoln University about the similarities between Judaism, Christianity and Islam. 
At the end of the talk some very devout Christians came up to me and said that there is no difference. There is. 
The concept of god, as we explained, is absolutely monotheistic. God had no son, he was never born and nobody has the right to do what he does, 
nor does anyone have the right to do anything other than him. In Islam if god legislate something it's absolute and this is a concept that doesn't exist in any other religion in that form. 

We also have a difference in our belief about the prophets. When you read the old testament, you'll find not very nice things being said about the prophets. 
You will find them accused of things that if they were alive today, I would not invite them in my house. 
You open your testament and it's simple to see that the concept of the prophet is different. In Islam, the prophet is the most perfect example of a human being, 
not absolutely perfect, however they are the best examples to mankind. Someone may turn around and say if you are critical 
of that part of the old testament how can you claim that Islam is continuation of that message. You will see that the bible has gone through many changes, 
it has been lost and found, it has developed and changed over time. We Muslims believe in the original concept. 
If you study the difference between the Hebrew and the Greek translations of the bible, you will see some differences and additions. 
As Muslims we affirm the original concept. For example the ten commandments. The first commandment [...] 
The general concept is that most of these commandments are the same as we find in Islam. When we come to Paul's preaching, 
we'll see principles that are not taught in Islam and this is a matter of study and debate. Muslims are saying essentially, 
it's the same in one way and it's different in another way, we believe in all of the people that Jews and Christians believe in, it's the same basic religion, but slightly different.

### Muslims are all Arabs?
Another misconception is that Muslims are all Arabs, or all Muslims are foreign and they're saying what they have seen with their own eyes. 
I went to Saudi Arabia to study in [...] for a while and in that city they invite people to study from all over the world, and they have over 100 ethnicities or nationalities, 
most of which the people who come from them are from that original ethnicity. 
You have people in Africa, huge number of Muslims who are ethnically from that area, people who traditionally come from that area. 
If you look at South America we met Brazilian Muslims, we met Venezuelan, from the Caribbean. 
In the UK we have a sizeable number of Muslims who don't come from any other ethnic background. 
We probably have some original English men Muslims, personally my family I believe that it originally comes from Germany at some point. 
If you look at Europe we've met Spanish, French, Portuguese. If you look at Russia there are many people who have had Muslims there for generations, 100 of years,
 with states that are predominantly Muslim. We've dispelled the concept that Muslims are Pakistani etc, and that they come from all sorts of different countries. 
I remember meeting people from countries I never even knew existed. China also has also a sizeable population of ethnic Muslim, so Islam is a global religion. 
Islam has a simple principle: There is no virtue for an Arab over a non-Arab, nor is there any virtue for a non Arab over an Arab except for piety, so Islam stamped out racism 1,400 years ago. 
Ask the brothers and sisters from South Africa how long has it been 
since South Africa stamped out open racism and how long the US has stamped out open racism. 
You had black people and white people praying in the same row and marrying into each other's families and being like brother and sister and not having issues with that. 
Now there are Muslims that are racists, but Islam isn't. [...]

### Terrorism
One thing that I wouldn't be doing any justice if I didn't talk about, was the issue of terrorism. 
Because a big misconception surrounding the Muslims, is that Muslims are sympathetic or empathetic towards terrorism and this is something that couldn't be further from the truth. 
Not only does Islam explicitly prohibit the killing of the innocent. Islam had the Geneva Convention 1400 years ago on the treatment of prisoners, 
people on the battlefield, not allowing to kill the innocent. Islam prohibited the destruction of buildings, you wouldn't think that after 9/11, 
but that's because there is a difference between Islam and a Muslim. Islam tells that it is forbidden to destroy peoples livelihoods, 
however we see that there are Muslims who have lost their way and indeed are involved in these things and it is our jobs as Muslims to deal with this issue. 
I genuinely accept those people who say that Muslims have not been active enough in dealing with this issue. 
For example one of the most famous versus from the Quran is to fight against those who fight against you. 
This proves that Muslims are violent! What is the next part of the verse [...] Do not go to extremes do not go beyond the limits. 
You do not find a single verse in the Quran that talks about fighting except that within that page somewhere above or below it 
there is a verse that talks about being balanced  and not go to extremes. On the issue of terrorism the prophet foretold of these people coming. 
It's well narrated that his cousin [...] who said, if it was not for the fact that I'd fear that you would go to extremes I would have told you the reward of killing these people. 
The people who use the religion as a justification for terrorizing who fight against the Muslims and who killed many of the noble scholars 
and who firstly target the Muslims who don't agree with them. 
There were bombings in [...] These are people who have errors in their belief and in their belief point of view they believe that everyone Muslim 
or non-Muslim who don't agree with them has to be killed. Islam commands us to fight against them and expose them. 
This is something that Islam is absolutely against. Muslims don't believe in any form of unnecessary violence. 
We have a narration which says that god said: I have forbidden oppression against myself, so do not oppress one-another. 
Another verse says: Do not allow the hatred of the people let you go to excess. This is a well known principle. 
Islam establishes these common principles and it has been a refuge for other religions. Muslim Spain was a refuge for the Jews of Europe,
 they sought refuge in the Muslim country because they were persecuted in Christian Europe, another historical evidence to show you that Islam is a religion of Justice. 

### Treatment of Women
A couple more points, it's worth mentioning the misconceptions that Muslims treat women badly. I think the opposite is true, 
I think Muslim men are oppressed by their wives. The prophet said the best of you are the best who best to your women folk, to your family.
 Yes there are Muslims who are abusive, and cultures who advocate forced marriage. A woman came to the prophet and said oh messenger of Allah my father forced me into marriage. 
He said, if you wish, I will divorce you from your husband immediately and if you wish you can stay with him. 
She said I wish to stay with him, but I want the other women to know that this is not something that is allowed in Islam. 
She wanted to make a point in a society that forced marriages was not allowed. If we find that a woman has been forced into a marriage, 
we offer her what she wishes to do and it's her choice. If she wishes to leave, she will leave instantly,  if she wishes to stay, 
she will stay with that person and the family will be rebuked according with the UK law. Islam gave rights to Muslim women that were never given even in this country 100 years ago. 
Islam does not have the same family perspective as in other countries but it doesn't cause any oppression to anyone.
 Someone might say why is the man the head of the household. We say it very simply, who does the man obey? 
His mother. It's forbidden for a man to disobey his mother. Islam doesn't say that women are second class citizens.
Implementation of the [...]
The second last thing that I want to talk about is that Muslims are here to implement [...] This is a common misconception, 
spread by people who want to sensationalize Islam to push Muslims to the fringes of their societies. The word [...] is a divine law that was revealed by god to a prophet. 
It's only a scary word when you use it on the front of a paper headline or when Muslims use it incorrectly. 
For applying [...] to punishments, it's not true. They don't take up a great deal of space inside the Quran, it's about to how you pray, 
how you're kind to other people. As for Muslims wanting to implement [...] in the UK. 
If you mean that Muslims want to practice as much of their religion as possible then I think that this is something that all religions have. 
As for the concept that Muslims want to remove the acts of parliament, this is not true, because they are required, 
when living in non-Muslim states, to respect the law within the limits of the law while trying not to contradict their religion. 
This is not to say that we don't want certain laws to change, I'm sure everyone wants parking fines to be abolished, 
this is something normal that every citizen has, and everyone tries to do it by advocacy. As for some secret cabal that digs around parliament to replace it, 
it doesn't exist within mainstream courts. 
What about [...] courts? The reality is that they are no different than any other courts that deal with arbitration. It's no different to the basic rules of arbitration. 

If the [...] 

### Muslims don't have fun
Big misconception that I want to finish with. And that is that Muslims don't have fun, especially towards Muslim women. 
The reality is that Muslims have lots of fun, and they are very sociable, probably more sociable than most people, 
because we have the socializing built around our religion. You don't need alcohol to have a laugh, you need good friends good company, good people. 
We had a non-Muslim guy at work and he was a bit surprised at first. We took him on holiday with us and the rule is no alcohol for the week. 
We had some great fun, we went all over the place, had great meals, met great people. Muslims do have fun and there is a concept on the same ideas,
 Muslim women are just as much into fashion, as non-Muslim women have but they have their limits when their outside, 
and when they are inside their houses or in a gathering of women or with close blood relations and husbands. 
Muslim men know that Muslim women are very much into the same things that other women are into. There's lots of other things that I would have liked to talk to you about, 
but it's been over an hour, so I would like to thank you very much for listening. 

_____________________________________________________________________________________

## Q & A

We have a lot of questions and we have 15 minutes so I'm going to get through them by giving succinct answers. 
I'm going to go through as many as possible. 

**First question: The basis of Christianity is Jesus Christ whom Christians believe is god, therefore can we say that Muslims and Christians have the same god?**

 Very briefly, if you mean that Jesus is god, then no we don't believe in the same god, but if you believe in the creator of the heavens and earth then this is the same god. 
There is a similarity in the concept of god originally and a difference in the concept of Jesus as the son of god. 
Where does the idea that events such as 9/11 are based on Islamic ideas come from? This is very easy to misunderstand because people who do such acts use Islam for their own aims,
and in religion in general there have been people who misuse religion for their own aims and that is not permissible to do in Islam. 
What is necessary violence and how can this be defined. Islam tells us in a passage of the Quran. If it were not for the fact 
that God tested one group of people to fight another then many mosques and churches would have been destroyed. 
There is a need to fight for the oppressed. If you look at the UN, if their peacekeeping force go into a land where the people are being harmed, 
this is a violence necessary to protect the innocent. I would say that apart from a small group of ultra pacifist people, 
almost everybody believes that there are times when the innocent have to be defended with violence, but it has to be appropriate 
and part of a legitimate army such as for example the police or the army. Why is reference always weighed to the prophet Mohammed for Islamic standards rather than the Quran. 
In a short statement and a short time of only an hour, we wanted to give you a clearer statement. I give you a verse from the Quran, 
but many of you may not understand what I'm getting at. If I was to quote all of the evidence for everything I would quote both the Quran and the prophet. 
[...] Indeed that which the prophet Mohamed makes forbidden, is like what Allah makes forbidden. 

**If Allah is neither male nor female why do we use him?** 

This is standard for Arabic language. Arabic isn't a language that has a word for it and we use it for things that don't have intelligence. 
In the end it is not a respectable word to use for god and she would indicate god is feminine so he doesn't necessitate that god has a gender. 
This is something that is a linguistic issue.

** Is there any reason for the separation between women and men and is it the same when Muslims pray?** 

This is something that is mentioned in Islam not as an original ruling, but as a principle for stopping things that lead to things that are forbidden.
 In Islam there is a belief that if people mix and socialize in ways that they are not supposed to those may lead to relationships developing outside of marriage. 
In with regard to prayer the men and the women prayed in the same room, they would not be mixed together in the same row, but they would be in the same room. 

When we started to build custom mosques we had lady sections and men section. I have found many non-Muslims find to be quite refreshing 
in gatherings where the men sit with the men and ladies sit with the ladies. It's quite natural and it's not taking away anything from women. 
Why can't Muslims eat pork, why do Muslim women cover their hair? 
I would refer you to talktoIslam.com. I apologize but I've got eight minutes. 
Can a Muslim woman be barefooted? 
In all seriousness this is something that scholars disagreed over, I personally think it has to be covered. 

**What do Muslims think about organ donations?** 

Islam allows organ donations within limits. There must be a real need for it, consent from the donor and it shouldn't cause any harm to him 
and if the donor is dead it has to be done with utmost respect for the body. I highly recommend Islamqa.com,
 however there is no person who is perfect and this has something on it that I personally don't agree with. 
Why do Muslims refer to themselves as slaves of god? 
In Islam the highest state you could reach is the state of servitude to god. As for being a slave of a human being it is wrong, 
because no human being is deserving of you dedicating your life to them such that your entire body and soul are given to them. 
That's why slavery among human beings it is something that is dispraised. God is deserving of you dedicating your body and service,
 so the way that we understand this, the most frequent mention of the prophet is as our slave. 

**If I have to turn to a particular direction to pray does this mean this is the only place god is at?**

 No. We have a verse in the Quran that says, wherever you turn your face you will find god. If a Muslim didn't know where [...] was, this is not a problem. 
The prayer direction unifies the Muslims. God is above the heavens. I'll answer this question out of fairness and I will try to answer it in the most appropriate way possible.

** What does Islam think about gay people?** 

It's become very difficult to express opposition to homosexuality without being considered to be an extremist. 
Islam doesn't allow it and considers it to be sinful. It is difficult for me to say any more about this topic, it is an extremely sensitive topic. 
In our life in the UK I've met many gay people, I had a good chat with Jonathan Miles, he is a gay man, and we came across this topic and he was surprised that I told him he could become a Muslim. Islam doesn't approve of it, however we certainly don't call forth any violence against gay people and this is illegal and we are required to abide by that. 
Is it ok if another Muslim is believing something is not right in Islam but you keep quiet? In Islam you are required to advise your brothers and sisters, you are required to prevent them from making mistakes. 

**What does Islam teach about forgiveness?** 

That god forgives everything if you repent from it, feel sorry for it and make right whatever wrong you have done. A just god is the one who punishes those who deserve to be punished an forgives those who deserve to be forgiven. Are there any circumstances whereby a man does not have to obey his mother? Only if his mother commands him to do something that is disobedience to god. Anyone who commands you whoever they are to do something against god you're not allowed to do it. If they are asking you to do something within the command of god then a person is required to obey them to the best of their ability. If a woman is working in a certain profession that requires her to dress in an un-Islamic way... There is a rule about the necessity, when there is a necessity to do something, Islam allows that, but it has to be judged whether or not is real or if a solution can be found.
I really do apologies for zooming through the question, but that's the best that I could do in a very short time. 


_**Thank you very much for listening for being patient with me and I hope that I will be able to see you again at an event in Sunderland or at any other event.**_
