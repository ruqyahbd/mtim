Here is a detailed description of the lecture "The Raaqi & His Family", The lecture essentially lays out the essential qualities a Raqi must embody, how they should safeguard their personal life and home, and what characteristics are expected from a patient seeking healing.

***

### **Characteristics of a *Raqi***

A *Raqi* must possess several crucial qualities to be effective and protected:

*   **Correct *Aqeedah* (Creed/Belief System)**: This is highlighted as the **foundation, shield, and "force field"** for the *Raqi*. A deep and well-versed understanding of Islamic *Aqeedah* is considered vital for protection and effectiveness.
*   **Sincerity (*Ikhlas*)**: The *Ruqya* must be performed **sincerely for the sake of Allah** alone, without seeking wealth, women, fame, or power, as this significantly impacts its effectiveness.
*   **Uprightness in Religion and Following the Sunnah**: A *Raqi* needs to be **firm and upright in Islam** and follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) to the best of their ability.
*   **Abstaining from Sinning**: It is crucial for a *Raqi* to **avoid major sins and minimize minor ones** as much as possible. Sins can create "cracks in his armor" or protection, which *Shayateen* (devils) can exploit to overcome him. While perfection is unattainable, consistent repentance is vital.
*   **Strong *Iman* (Faith) and Complete Trust and Reliance in Allah (SWT)**: A *Raqi* is constantly placing themselves in a position of potential danger when confronting *Shayateen*. They must have **firm conviction and complete reliance on Allah** alone, knowing that Allah is sufficient for them.
*   **Strong Belief in the Power of the Quran**: The *Raqi* must have a **firm belief in the *shifa* (healing) and power of the Quran**. They should reflect on verses that highlight the Quran's strength (e.g., if revealed to a mountain, it would turn to dust) to counter *Shaytan's* whispers of doubt during difficult sessions.
*   **Basic Understanding of *Fiqh* (Islamic Jurisprudence) Related to *Ruqya***: This includes knowing what is permissible or impermissible during a *Ruqya* session, such as **rules regarding touching a patient or being alone with a woman without a *mahram*** (unmarriageable kin).
*   **Enjoining Good and Forbidding Evil**: The *Raqi* should generally be someone who enjoins good and forbids evil, and specifically applies this with their patients and even with the *Jinn*. They should advise patients on religious matters like correct *hijab* (head covering) or abstaining from sins, as a **sin can directly impact recovery**.
*   **Acting in Accordance with the Quran and Sunnah**: The *Ruqya* session itself must **strictly adhere to the methods proven from the Quran and Sunnah** for greater effectiveness.
*   **Concealing What Happens During the Session**: The *Raqi* must **maintain the privacy of the patient**, not exposing their struggles, sins, or any private matters revealed by the *Jinn* during the session. Filming and sharing such content is forbidden.
*   **Gentle and Encouraging Character**: A *Raqi* should be **gentle, supportive, and encouraging** towards the suffering patient, never causing them to despair by suggesting their case is too difficult or incurable.
*   **Quick-Witted and Aware**: The *Raqi* needs to be **able to think under pressure** and handle unexpected or unusual situations that may arise during a session. They need full concentration and awareness for this "battle".
*   **Constant Seeking of Knowledge and Avoidance of Pride**: A *Raqi* should continuously seek Islamic knowledge, read books, engage in *dhikr* (remembrance of Allah), and avoid arrogance and pride (*kibr*), as these can **weaken them and reduce the effectiveness of their *Ruqya***.

### **Protection of the *Raqi***

The *Raqi* is considered a *mujahid* (one striving in Allah's cause), and their protection primarily comes from Allah (SWT).

*   **Divine Protection**: A *Raqi* who is **just, establishes Allah's laws, and relies on Allah** will generally not be significantly harmed by *Jinn*. Powerful *Jinn* might cause minor harm like a **twitch, headache, earache, or a limb going numb**, but these are considered pathetic due to Allah's ultimate protection.
*   **Personal Protective Practices**:
    *   **Reading the last two *Surahs* of the Quran** (Al-Falaq and An-Nas).
    *   Engaging in **prayer (*Salat*) and *Dua*** (supplication).
    *   Continuously **strengthening *Iman***.
    *   **Avoiding sins**: Sins can be a means by which *Shayateen* overcome the *Raqi*.

### **Protecting the *Raqi*'s Home**

The *Raqi*'s home must be a sanctuary free from *Shayateen* influence:

*   **Place of Allah's Remembrance (*Dhikr*)**: The home should be filled with **remembrance, glorification, exaltation, praise, and seeking forgiveness from Allah**. A home without *dhikr* is like a grave.
*   **No Pictures of Living Beings or Dogs**: Angels do not enter homes where there are pictures (of living beings/faces) or dogs on display. Where angels do not enter, *Shayateen* may enter.
*   **No Music**: Music is seen as inviting *Shayateen* into the home. Instead, the **words of Allah (Quran) should be heard**.
*   **No Amulets**: Amulets should not be present in the home. An exception is if they are brought temporarily for destruction (though destroying them outside the home is preferred).
*   **Saying *Bismillah* (In the Name of Allah)**:
    *   Upon **entering the home**: Prevents *Shaytan* from having a place to stay.
    *   When **closing and locking doors**: Prevents *Shaytan* from entering.
    *   When **eating**: Prevents *Shaytan* from sharing the food. If *Bismillah* is not said, *Shaytan* can have a place to eat and sleep, treating the house like a hotel.
*   **Reciting Surah Al-Baqarah**: This *Surah* should be recited in the home **at least once every three days**. *Shayateen* do not enter a house where Surah Al-Baqarah is recited, and magicians cannot stand against its power. This also prevents homes from becoming like graves.
*   **Removing Anything Displeasing to Allah**: Generally, striving for obedience to Allah within the home.

### **Protecting the *Raqi*'s Children**

Parents, especially the *Raqi*, have a responsibility to protect their children:

*   **Reciting Specific *Duas***: Parents should place their hands over their children's heads and **recite *duas* seeking refuge for them in Allah's perfect words from every evil devil, evil eye, or stinging insect**.
*   **Teaching *Duas* Early**: As soon as children can speak, they should be taught these *duas* and to seek refuge for themselves.
*   **Reciting Protective *Surahs* Before Sleep**: Before children go to sleep, *Surahs* Al-Ikhlas, Al-Falaq, and An-Nas should be recited three times each, and blown over their bodies.
*   **Teaching Correct *Aqeedah* from a Young Age**: Even from two years old, children should be taught basic *Aqeedah*, such as Allah being above the heavens, to plant the seeds of correct belief, which acts as protection.

### **Characteristics of the Patient**

The *Raqi* should also guide and ensure certain qualities in the patient for effective *Ruqya*:

*   **Correct *Aqeedah***: The *Raqi* should assess the patient's *Aqeedah* at the beginning, guiding them if necessary. If a patient believes Allah is "everywhere" or calls upon the dead, the *Raqi* may even **refuse *Ruqya* until their *Aqeedah* is corrected**, as incorrect beliefs can negate any progress made. All *shifa* (healing) comes from Allah alone.
*   **Sincerity and Complete Reliance in Allah**: Patients must understand that the *Raqi* cannot benefit or harm them; **all healing is from Allah alone**. They should place their full trust in Allah.
*   **Uprightness in Religion and Following the Sunnah**: Patients should be encouraged to be **upright in their religion and follow the Sunnah** of the Prophet (PBUH).
*   **Abstaining from Sins**: Patients should be advised to **stay away from sins**, as even a single sin can potentially prevent Allah's healing (*shifa*) from reaching them.
*   **Strong Belief in the Quran**: Patients need to understand that the **Quran is sufficient** for healing and should not rely on "fancy things" or other remedies.
*   **Patience**: Patients must be **patient** and understand that healing occurs according to Allah's will and decree. They should not be hasty or question "why am I not getting better," as such impatience or incorrect *Aqeedah* can hinder recovery.

In summary, the lecture emphasizes that the success of *Ruqya* is deeply intertwined with the spiritual state, *Aqeedah*, and righteous practices of both the *Raqi* and the patient, all under the ultimate protection and decree of Allah (SWT).
