# The Ruqya Session
<sup>Version 0.1</sup>

_**Note: This lecture summary is generated by Google NotebookLM and was not available on the Ustaz's Original Note site.**_

This lecture, "The Ruqya Session," is an in-depth exploration of the practical aspects of performing Ruqya, breaking down the process into stages: before, during, and after the session. It emphasizes that while the lecture provides significant guidance, continued experience and seeking knowledge will further enhance a practitioner's ability. The speakers strongly encourage active participation and practice in Ruqya due to a desperate need for practitioners who undertake this responsibility for the sake of Allah.


***

## **I. Before the Ruqya Session**

The preparation before the actual recitation is crucial for a successful and divinely blessed session.

*   **Discussion with the Patient:**
    *   **Enjoining Good and Forbidding Evil:** It is vital to set ground rules, such as requiring female patients to wear a hijab. This reinforces Islamic principles and clarifies expectations, as compromise is not advised.
    *   **Time Management:** The Raqi must manage the session time effectively to ensure sufficient Quran recitation. Patients, especially those suffering for many years, may want to share extensive details of their experiences, which can consume valuable time meant for Ruqya. The *Shaytan* (devil) actively tries to delay or prevent recitation. It's advised to have a clear idea of how long the conversation should take and prioritize the most pertinent questions.
    *   **Quality of Questions:** The Raqi should ask valuable questions that directly relate to the issue, similar to how a companion wisely asked "What did you do?" when a scorpion stung someone, seeking beneficial information rather than irrelevant details.
    *   **Da'wah (Calling to Islam):** While Da'wah is extremely valuable and can sometimes be the sole focus of a session, the decision to extend the discussion for Da'wah should be the Raqi's conscious choice, not a delay imposed by Shaytan.
    *   **Pre-Session Preparation:** To save time during the session, it's highly recommended to gather patient history (e.g., how long they've been suffering, symptoms, how and when it began) via email or text message before they arrive. This allows the majority of in-person time to be dedicated to Quran recitation.
    *   **Avoiding Prompting:** The Raqi should avoid overly prompting patients or putting words in their mouths, as this can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Instead, allow them to speak freely and then ask specific, clarifying questions based on their statements.
    *   **Patient Ground Rules & Adhkar:** The Raqi may set rules for the patient and advise them on specific *Adhkar* (remembrances). However, it's essential **not to overburden the patient** with too many or excessively long Adhkar. Small, continuous deeds are more beloved to Allah than large, inconsistent ones.
    *   **Dreams:** Inquire about dreams, but be extremely cautious in interpreting them, as Shaytan can use nightmares and falsehoods to mislead. It's crucial to distinguish between dreams from Allah, the soul, and Shaytan.
    *   **Previous Treatments:** Ask if the patient has sought help from other Raqis or individuals. This is not to create conflict but to understand their history, previous advice, and whether they encountered anyone involved in magic, and if they still possess any amulets (which should be destroyed).

*   **Dealing with Female Patients (Fitnah of Women):**
    *   The lecture highlights that a majority of cases often involve women, and the Prophet (PBUH) feared the temptation (*fitnah*) of women for his *Ummah*.
    *   **Strict Rules for Mahram:** It is absolutely essential for a female patient to come with a *Mahram* (unmarriageable kin). The Mahram's presence prevents many problems and evils.
    *   **Lowering the Gaze:** The Raqi must adhere to the command to lower the gaze. **Staring at the sister is unnecessary and dangerous**. Personally, one of the speakers prefers to read from behind the patient and maintain more than an arm's distance to prevent any urges or temptations.
    *   **Necessity (*Darurah*) vs. Convenience:** The concept of *darurah* (eating pork to survive) is used to illustrate that touching a non-Mahram woman is only permissible under extreme necessity, not for convenience or trivial reasons. Many Raqis are criticized for being too casual with physical contact.
    *   **Female Assistants:** Having a female relative or a trustworthy sister (like an "auntie" or a responsible elder sister) present is highly recommended. She can assist with adjusting the patient's hijab, looking after her, and serving as a witness against false accusations.
    *   **Avoiding *Khalwa* (Being Alone):** Never be alone with a non-Mahram woman. Shaytan becomes the third party when a man and woman are alone together. If a Mahram is unavailable, at least ensure another sister is present from the patient's side, and preferably one from the Raqi's side for accountability.

*   **The Ruqya Partner:**
    *   Having a Ruqya partner is highly beneficial. They can provide support, remind the Raqi of forgotten things, correct mistakes in recitation, help with practical needs (like getting water), and swap recitations if one gets tired.
    *   A partner also serves as a witness against potential false accusations, especially with new patients.

*   **Patient Prioritization:**
    *   Patients should be categorized by severity. Highest priority is given to those who are critically ill (e.g., told they are dying) or those who are not praying or practicing Islam, as their spiritual state is most precarious.
    *   The Raqi should not make grand promises of a cure but instead promise to do their best within the circumstances Allah provides. Trust for the cure should always be placed in Allah alone.

## **II. During the Ruqya Session**

This is the core of the practical application of Ruqya, requiring specific conduct from the Raqi and a controlled environment.

*   **Raqi's Attitude:**
    *   **Correct Attitude and Humility:** The Raqi must enter the session with the correct attitude, humility before Allah, and by making *Dua* (supplication).
    *   **Composure and Calmness:** It is paramount for the Raqi to remain calm and composed, even if the patient reacts strongly or the Jin tries to intimidate. Panicking will cause the patient to lose trust and empower the Jin. This composure stems from a strong *Aqeedah* and complete reliance on Allah, knowing that nothing can harm them except what Allah has decreed.

*   **Environment and Setup:**
    *   **Safe Environment:** Ensure the environment is safe, especially if the patient is possessed and might react violently. There should be no sharp objects or hazards that could cause injury if the patient jumps or falls.
    *   **Conducive to Recitation:** The environment must be free from distractions: no children running around, no phones ringing, no unnecessary noise. Everyone present should listen attentively to the Quran recitation, as this is essential for receiving Allah's mercy and healing.

*   **Recitation Process:**
    *   **Beginning Recitation:** Start by seeking refuge in Allah and saying "Bismillah".
    *   **Sunnah Surahs/Ayat:** Begin with *Surah Al-Fatiha*, followed by *Ayatul Kursi* (from Surah Al-Baqarah), the last two verses of Surah Al-Baqarah, and the three Quls (*Surah Al-Ikhlas*, *Al-Falaq*, *An-Nas*). These are typically recited three, five, or seven times, or other odd numbers. There needs to be evidence to specify an exact number of recitations; otherwise, an odd number or general increase is sufficient.
    *   **No Immediate Reaction:** It is important to note that a lack of immediate or apparent reaction from the patient does not mean there is no Jin, Sihr, or evil eye present. The Jin might be hiding.
    *   **Ayat of Specific Purpose:** Progress to verses that have a clear purpose, such as those mentioning Sihr (magic) or Jin. These verses remind the Jin of their purpose of creation (worshipping Allah) and challenge them.
    *   **Tailoring and Experience:** The Raqi will develop their own methodology and unique way, tailoring the session based on experience and knowledge.
    *   **Observing Reactions:** Look for subtle signs like twitching in fingers, shoulders, face, or neck. When these are observed, focus on that area.

*   **Physical Interaction During Ruqya (Extremely Sensitive Area):**
    *   **Light Pressure:** If twitching is observed, *light* pressure can be applied to the affected area. However, the Raqi should **never use excessive force, beating, or violent actions** as these can harm the patient. The Quran itself is the core of the treatment and is powerful enough.
    *   **Mahram's Role in Physical Contact:** When dealing with female patients, the Raqi should instruct the Mahram to apply pressure or touch the patient if needed, avoiding direct physical contact himself.
    *   **Conditions for Touching a Non-Mahram Woman (Necessity Only):** There are only three specific, rare circumstances where a Raqi might consider touching a non-Mahram woman, and even then, only if a Mahram is unable or absent:
        1.  **Self-Harm:** If the patient attempts to self-harm (e.g., choking herself, grabbing a knife). The Raqi should intervene immediately to prevent harm, to the necessary extent.
        2.  **Attacking the Raqi/Others:** If the patient attacks the Raqi or others in the room. Restrain them only to the extent necessary to ensure safety.
        3.  **Considerable Benefit for Cure (Gray Area):** This is the trickiest and highly advised to avoid unless the Raqi has immense experience and genuinely believes it offers a considerable, unique benefit for cure (e.g., a lump appearing where Jin is present). This is likened to a doctor's intervention but is extremely rare and requires utmost fear of Allah and self-accountability. It should never be an excuse for intimate touching or following the Jin around the body.
    *   **Accountability:** The Raqi should always take themselves to account afterwards, discussing with a partner if any action (especially touching) was truly necessary or if it could have been avoided.
    *   **Safe Restraining:** If physical restraint is needed, it must be done safely and comfortably, controlling joints rather than twisting limbs, ensuring the patient's airway is clear, and preventing self-injury.

*   **When the Jin Speaks:**
    *   **Do Not Panic/Stop Reciting:** When the Jin begins to speak or there are external disturbances (e.g., moving objects), the Raqi **must not become scared, panic, or stop the recitation**.
    *   **Limited Conversation:** **Avoid long, drawn-out conversations with the Jin.** The Jin's primary aim in speaking is to make the Raqi stop reciting, allowing it to recover.
    *   **Command, Don't Debate:** The communication with the Jin should be short, snappy commands: "Leave this person's body," "Fear Allah," "You are oppressing him." Warn them of being killed by Allah's permission if they don't leave.
    *   **Do Not Believe the Jin:** Never take anything the Jin says as truth. Take it "with a huge pinch of salt." Do not affirm or deny it unless it aligns with the Quran and Sunnah. Avoid asking about tribes, plans, or internal details.
    *   **No Pacts or Assistance:** **Never make a pact with the Jin or seek assistance from them, or call upon anyone other than Allah**. This compromises *Aqeedah*.
    *   **Ignore Threats:** The Jin will often issue endless threats (e.g., "I know where you live," "I'll kill your family"). **Completely ignore these threats**, as the Jin can only do what Allah permits.
    *   **Purpose of Jin Speaking:** Sometimes, when the Jin is burnt by the Quran and desperate, it might reveal why it's there (e.g., love, Sihr). Again, do not take this as absolute fact.

## **III. After the Ruqya Session**

Concluding the session safely and professionally is important.

*   **Observation Period:** After concluding the recitation, the patient should be observed for approximately **10-15 minutes** to ensure they are stable, comfortable, and that the Jin has "let go".
*   **Safety Precautions:** If the patient is driving themselves home, this observation period should be considerably longer to prevent any harm.
*   **Professional Conduct:** The entire process should be handled professionally, ensuring the patient's safety and comfort at all times. Learning basic first aid or safe restraining techniques (like "Jing Jitsu") is beneficial.

In essence, the lecture emphasizes that the success of a Ruqya session hinges on the Raqi's **firm *Aqeedah*, complete reliance on Allah, strict adherence to the Sunnah, and a professional, cautious approach** throughout all stages.
