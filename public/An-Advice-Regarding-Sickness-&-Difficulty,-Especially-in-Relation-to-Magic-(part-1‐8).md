# An Advice Regarding Sickness & Difficulty, Especially in Relation to Magic

This is a long piece which I wrote to one of my first ruqyah patients. I think it is - by the grace of Allāh - beneficial for any person experiencing hardship or difficulty in their lives, especially due to sickness, and even more so when that sickness is caused by the jinn, magic & the evil eye.

I've broken it down into a number of sections (they're supposed to be read in order):

1. [The Importance of Taqwā](#part-one-taqwā)
2. [Knowledge & Action](#part-two-knowledge--action)
3. [What Every Sick Muslim Needs to Know](#part-three-what-every-sick-muslim-needs-to-know)
4. [Du'a & Its Etiquettes](#part-four-dua--its-etiquettes)
5. [Reliance & Medicine](#part-five-reliance-and-medicine)
6. [The Prayer](#part-six-the-prayer)
7. [Plots of the Shaytān](#part-seven-the-plots-of-the-shaytān)
8. [Magic & Magicians](#part-eight-magic--magicians)

## Part One: Taqwā

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>In the name of Allāh, The Most Merciful, The Bestower of Mercy</strong></p>

All praise is due to Allāh alone. We praise Him, we seek His help, and we ask for His forgiveness. Whomsoever Allāh guides, there is none who can misguide him, and whomsoever Allāh misguides, there is none who can guide him. I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allāh, alone and with no partner; and I bear witness that Muhammad – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – is Allāh’s slave and final messenger.


To continue, Allāh has made giving sincere advice obligatory for every Muslim. Allāh The Exalted said:


> **"By time, Indeed, mankind is in loss, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds and advise each other to truth and advise each other to patience."**

And His Messenger – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said:

>_"The religion is [giving] sincere advice."_ The companions replied: "To whom, O Messenger of Allāh?" He said – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him, _"To Allāh, His Book, His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and the general people."_


The best general advice that can be given to anyone is the advice to have _taqwā_ of Allāh. Taqwā is to put a barrier between yourself and between Allāh’s anger by doing everything that Allāh orders you to do and keeping away from everything which Allāh forbids you, whilst keeping the correct intention, and making sure that the action is in accordance with the _sunnah_ of the Messenger of Allāh (may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him). 

There is no doubt that taqwā is the key to success in this world and the hereafter. Allāh The Exalted said:

> **"And take provisions [for your journey], but indeed, the best provision is taqwā. And fear Me, O you of understanding."**

Taqwā is also the key to knowledge, as Allāh said:

>**"And have taqwā of Allāh and Allāh teaches you".**

Just as taqwā is a way out of every problem, as Allāh said: 

>**"And whoever has taqwā of Allāh - He will make for him a way out [from every difficulty], and provide for him from [sources] he never could imagine. And whoever relies upon Allāh - then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allāh will accomplish His purpose. Allāh has already set for everything a [decreed] extent."**

## Part Two: Knowledge & Action  
([see index](#an-advice-regarding-sickness--difficulty-especially-in-relation-to-magic))

Know – may Allāh have mercy on you – that knowledge comes before action. Allāh The Exalted said:

>**"So know, [O Muhammad], that there is no god except Allāh and ask forgiveness for your sin".**

In this passage, Allāh put knowledge before action. This interpretation is supported by Imām Al- Bukhari in his _Saheeh_ when he wrote: "Chapter: Knowledge comes before action", then he mentioned the previous _āyah_. Having said that, knowledge without action leads to the Hellfire – may Allāh save you and I from it. This is because knowledge is either a witness for you or against you. The punishment of the person who knows something is wrong and then does it is not equal to the punishment of the person who is ignorant of something he should know, even if they both deserve to be punished. One of the first three to be thrown in to the hellfire on the Day of Judgment will be a scholar who did not act upon what he knew, as is authentically reported from the Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him. Yet, as Muslims, we have been ordered to seek knowledge. Allāh The Exalted said:

> **"Say, ‘Are those who know equal to those who do not know?’ Only they will remember [who are] people of understanding."** 

Furthermore, there are many narrations from the Prophet – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – praising the one who seeks knowledge and the great rewards. From these narrations is that, _"everything in the heavens and the earth seeks forgiveness for the scholar (in one narration: for the student of knowledge), even the fish in the sea"._


Know – may Allāh guide you to obey Him – that the best of knowledge is knowing Allāh’s Perfect Names and Attributes. There is no doubt that this leads the Muslim to worshipping Allāh as He deserves to be worshipped. Allāh said:

>**"It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allāh."**

When a person knows Allāh’s infinite power and Allāh’s severe punishment, they fear Allāh more. When a person knows Allāh’s mercy, which has encompassed every single thing, even the animals, they increase in their hope in Him. Sufyān ath-Thawree – one of the great imāms of hadith – said that if he had a choice on the Day of Judgement between Allāh deciding his fate or his father, he would choose Allāh. This statement shows the Imām’s knowledge of Allāh’s Perfect Attributes; would someone’s father ever choose the hellfire for them? And yet Allāh’s mercy is greater than the mercy of a mother to her baby, as the Messenger of Allāh told us – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him.


When a person knows that Allāh hears and sees everything, it makes them stand firm upon the religion. ‘Ā’ishah – may Allāh be pleased with her – said, "Glory be to the one who’s hearing reaches every sound!" She was sitting in her tiny room when a woman came to the Prophet regarding her husband and yet ‘Ā’ishah couldn’t hear everything the woman said to him. Then Allāh sent down His statement, **"Certainly has Allāh heard the speech of the one who argues with you, [O Muhammad], concerning her husband and directs her complaint to Allāh . And Allāh hears your dialogue; indeed, Allāh is Hearing and Seeing."**


When a person knows that Allāh accepts the repentance of everyone who turns back to Him, it makes him sincere and eager to turn back to Allāh in repentance. The Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said:

>*"Verily, Allāh is more pleased with the repentance of His slave than a person who has lost his camel carrying his food and drink in a waterless desert. He, having lost all hope, lies down in shade and with no hope of finding his camel again; when all of a sudden he finds that camel standing before him. He takes hold of its reins and then out of boundless joy blurts out: 'O Allāh, You are my slave and I am Your lord'. He makes this mistake out of extreme joy."*


When a person knows that *"Allāh is Shy when His servant raises his hands to Him to return them empty"*, he never ceases to call upon His Lord, *"even for a shoelace,"* as the Messenger of Allāh (peace and blessing of Allāh be upon him) said. And he continues like this until his relationship with His Lord means more to him than Allāh giving him what he wants. The Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said:

>*"Du’ā is [the essence of] worship".*

 One of the reasons for this is that du’ā joins between so many different types of worship; love, hope, reliance, and patience, to name a few, and it makes the servant realise the greatness of Allāh, and the servant's need of Him.

 
When a person knows that **"if Allāh touches you with harm, none can remove it but He, and if He touches you with good, then He is Able to do all things"**, their heart becomes free of relying upon anyone except Allāh. When they are in need they turn to him alone, and when they are in touched by hardship they know that nobody can remove their hardship except Him. One of our scholars – may Allāh preserve him – said that whenever he got in a difficult situation he used to read this āyah, and he never read it except that Allāh made a way out for him from his difficulty. And there is no doubt that all of this depends on a person knowing his or her Lord.


***

## Part Three: What Every Sick Muslim Needs to Know
([see index](#an-advice-regarding-sickness--difficulty-especially-in-relation-to-magic))


Know – may Allāh guide you to His straight path – that Allāh The Exalted has made seeking knowledge obligatory upon every Muslim man and woman. From this knowledge that Allāh has made obligatory are the Pillars of Islām and Imān. It is not enough for a Muslim to simply know of them; rather he or she must understand their meanings and conditions. For example, "I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allāh and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allāh" has a meaning which must be understood and it has conditions. From the meaning of "I bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allāh" is that there is nothing on the face of this earth, nor in the heavens worthy of any kind of worship except Allāh; whether that is worship of the heart, like hope, fear and love, or whether worship of the tongue like _dhikr_ and _du’ā_, or worship of the limbs, like _sujood_ and _tawāf_. It doesn’t matter whether that thing which is worshipped besides Allāh is the most noble of the angels, or the greatest of the prophets. If those angels and prophets do not deserve even the tiniest amount of that worship, then there is no doubt that those things which have less status than them deserve none of it. This is the meaning of Allāh’s statement: 

>**"So whoever disbelieves in false gods and believes in Allāh has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break…"**

This most trustworthy handhold is ‘lā ilāha ill-Allāh’ as the scholars of tafseer have mentioned. This āyah comprises the two parts of ‘lā ilāha ill-Allāh’: believing in Allāh, and disbelieving in everything else that is worshipped besides Him. So whoever disbelieves in everything else but does not believe in Allāh is an atheist, and whoever believes in Allāh but does not disbelieve in everything else is a polytheist.

In addition, ‘lā ilāha ill-Allāh’ has seven conditions which must be fulfilled – it is not enough to just say the words; every person must know what they mean, must believe them without any doubt, must accept what they lead us to do, must submit completely, must be true in their belief, must be sincere in seeking Allāh’s pleasure, and must love Allāh over and above the love of anything or anyone else.


As for the meaning of "I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allāh," it is to believe in what he told us about, to follow him in what he ordered, and not to worship Allāh except in the way that he told us. So, when we put the two together, we find the two conditions that must be present for any action to be accepted by Allāh:


1. The action must be done sincerely for Allāh
2. The action must be in accordance with the sunnah of the Messenger of Allāh –
may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him –.

The proof for this rule can be found in Allāh’s statement:

>**"So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord - let him do righteous work and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord".**

 The first condition can be found in Allāh’s statement, **"and not associate anyone in the worship of his Lord"**, and the second condition can be found in Allāh’s statement, **"let him do righteous work;"** because there is no doubt that the Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – didn’t leave any good deed except that he informed his ummah about it, just as he didn’t leave any bad deed except that he warned his ummah against it.

 
From the proofs which illustrate the importance of the following the sunnah is the narration of Al-Barā’ ibn ‘Āzib – may Allāh be pleased with him – that on the day of ‘eid he slaughtered his sacrifice before the ‘eid prayer (which is against the sunnah), and he did so with the best of intentions; so that the Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him –
and his companions could eat as soon as they finished the prayer, and so that he would have the honour of being the first to feed the Messenger of Allāh. The Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said: *"Your sheep is [just] meat"*, i.e., you do not have any reward for it in the sight of Allāh.

From the pillars of imān is to believe in Allāh. Belief in Allāh requires that you know Allāh; else how can you worship and believe in something that you don’t know? Therefore, it is obligatory for every Muslim man and woman to learn the perfect names and attributes of Allāh and their meanings, and to act upon them – as mentioned above.


Furthermore, you cannot have imān until you believe in Allāh’s qadar (divine decree) – the good and the bad of it. In the first hadeeth in Saheeh Muslim, on the authority of Yahyā ibn Ya'mur, we find that he said to Ibn ‘Umar – may Allāh be pleased with them both:

>*"O Abā Abdur-Rahman! [i.e., Ibn ‘Umar], there have appeared some people in our land who recite the Qur’ān and pursue knowledge. Then after talking about them, he added: They claim that there is no such thing as qadar and events are not predestined."* Abdullah ibn‘ Umar said: *If you meet such people tell them that I have nothing to do with them and they have nothing to do with me. By The One who Abdullah ibn ‘Umar swears by (i.e. Allāh): If any one of them had with him gold equal to the bulk of (the mountain) Uhud and then spent it (in the way of Allāh), Allāh would not accept it unless he believed in qadar…"* Then, he mentioned the hadeeth of Jibreel - peace be upon him – and in it Jibreel said, *"tell me about imān."* The Prophet – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – replied,*"That you believe in Allāh, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Day of Judgment, and you believe in qadar – the good and the bad of it."*


Believing in qadar means believing in four stages:


1. Allāh’s knowledge – that Allāh knows what happened and what will happen and what would happen if something else happened. Allāh has always known all of this and will always know it. There is no limit to Allāh’s knowledge and nobody can encompass even the smallest part of His knowledge – except as Allāh wills. As Allāh says in *āyat-ul- kursee*: **"He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills."**
2. That Allāh wrote every single thing that will happen until the Last Day in the Preserved Tablet. As Allāh says: **"No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register before We bring it into being - indeed that, for Allāh, is easy."**
3. That nothing happens – evil or good – without Allāh’s will and permission. That doesn’t mean that we don’t have a will. We can easily testify that when we stand up, it is because we want to. But our will cannot exist without Allāh’s will. How many times do we find ourselves certain that we are going to do something, and then suddenly something comes up and we can’t complete what we wanted to do? On top of that, think about who gave you your will and your intelligence, your strength and your ability, and who is capable of taking all of that away from you in a second...of course the answer is Allāh. It is also vital that you understand that Allāh’s will is of two types: Something that He wills and loves, and something that He wills but he doesn’t love. Everything that happens in the heavens and the earth happens by Allāh’s will – good and evil. But Allāh only loves that which is good. A person could ask ‘then why does Allāh will something to happen that he doesn’t love?’ The answer is that Allāh has infinite wisdom and he doesn’t create pure evil for the sake of it. Even in the creation of Iblees – may Allāh curse him – there is great wisdom and justice. Secondly, Allāh doesn’t will for these things to happen because of the things themselves, but because he wants other things to happen because of them. To give you a simple example: If you have a child who needs a leg amputated, do you cut the child’s leg off for the sake of cutting it, or because the effect of cutting off the child’s leg is that you will save their life by Allāh’s permission? Look at some of the things that happen because of sin: (a) Repentance – one of the most beloved things to Allāh (b) The knowledge that Allāh is the Most Forgiving (c) The slave knows that they are in desperate need of his Lord (d) Just as the slave wants to be forgiven, he forgives others; these things are just a few that are obvious to us, whereas Allāh’s knowledge is infinite and His wisdom is perfect.
4. That Allāh created us and creates everything that we do. As Allāh said: **"While Allāh created you and that which you do."** And there is no contradiction between this and the fact that we are the ones who act, because creating something is not the same as doing it. We all accept that Allāh created every single one of us, and at the same time we accept that we came from our mothers’ wombs. When you reflect upon this example you see that Allāh can create directly, as He created Ādam, or he can create by means of something else, like he created us by means of our mothers and fathers.


Thousands upon thousands of Muslims have been misguided when it comes to qadar. That is because the nature of qadar is part of Allāh’s infinite knowledge, and our intelligence is limited. However, when a person understands each part of qadar point by point and submits to Allāh completely, there is nothing difficult about it at all. It helps to bear in mind a few important points:

1. That Allāh is infinitely just. He never oppresses any of His slaves and He never will. Allāh said,"**and because Allāh is not ever unjust to His servants."** And Allāh said in a hadeeth that the Prophet – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – reported from his Lord: *"O My servants, I have forbidden oppression for Myself and have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another."*
2. That Allāh is All Wise. Every single thing that Allāh does is based on perfect wisdom. Even though we may not fully understand the wisdom for something – to accuse Allāh of foolishness or injustice is disbelief which takes someone out of the religion of Islam; this includes such statements as "Why me!?" and "I don’t deserve this!?". Allāh said, **"Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?"** and Allāh said, **"Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing."**
3. That it is obligatory for every Muslim to act and work hard. Qadar can never be an excuse for not acting. This is because Allāh has created things that cause other things to happen. Imagine a person who sat on his own in his house saying ,‘If Allāh wills me to have a child it will happen’. Everybody would laugh at his stupidity and say, ‘go and get married!’ Even more stupid than him is the person who doesn’t worship Allāh to the best of his ability saying: ‘If Allāh has written that I will go to Paradise – I will go.’
4. You don’t know what Allāh has written for you, therefore you have no choice but to act and do your best. In fact Allāh has promised that the people who work hard to seek Allāh’s pleasure that Allāh will make it easy for them: **"As for he who gives and fears Allāh, And believes in the best [reward], We will make smooth for him the path of ease."**
5. That it is completely harām to ever use the word "Why?" when it comes to qadar, just like it is harām to use the word "How?" when it comes to the Attributes of Allāh.


You may ask ‘why explain qadar at all?’The answer is that when a Muslim believes completely in qadar and submits to Allāh’s will there are a huge number of benefits in his or her life, particularly when times are difficult, these include:

1. Perfecting your tawheed – because belief in qadar is a part of the Oneness of Allāhin His Lordship; that He has complete control of the world and everything that is in it, and everything depends completely upon him.
2. Increasing your imān – As Allāh says,**"No disaster strikes except by permission of Allāh. And whoever believes in Allāh - He will guide his heart. And Allāh is Knowing of all things."** Alqamah – may Allāh have mercy on him – said: "The āyah is referring to a person who is struck by a disaster but he knows it is from Allāh so he accepts it and is pleased with it" – and so Allāh guides his heart.
3. Achieving true ikhlās (sincerity) – because you realise that Allāh controls everything and therefore there is no reason to show off in front of anyone else.
4. Achieving complete trust in Allāh – because when you know that everything comes from Allāh you rely on him completely.
5. Fear of Allāh – because when you really believe in qadar you accept that you don’t know what is written for you at the end of your life.
6. Achieving true patience – because everything that happens is from Allāh and you can’t change it, so it makes you practice being patient upon every single thing that happens to you. Patience is from the attributes of the believers. Allāh said, **"And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient, Who, when disaster strikes them, say, ‘Indeed we belong to Allāh, and indeed to Him we will return.’ Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy. And it is those who are the [rightly] guided."** Patience is the way of the Prophets and the pious. Luqmān the wise advised his son, **"O my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient over what befalls you. Indeed, [all] that is of the matters [requiring] determination."** Patience is of three general types: (a) patience in doing good deeds, (b) patience in keeping away from sins, and (c) patience over what happens to you from the qadar of Allāh. When you achieve this – being patient upon what happens to you and thanking Allāh for what He has given you – you become from those people who the Messenger of Allāh (peace and blessings be upon him) said about them, *"How wonderful is the case of a believer; there is good for him in everything. If he is prosperous, he expresses gratitude to Allāh and that is good for him; and if adversity befalls him, he endures it patiently and that is better for him."*
7. There is a level of belief in qadar that is even higher than being patient; to be content with what happens to you as a result of qadar, and finally to be happy with what happens to you because you know that Allāh is the one who decreed it for you; that is the highest level of belief in qadar.
8. It allows you to be satisfied with what you have, and to be far away from jealousy, because you could not have got what the other person had and they could not have got what you have, and you know that every single form of good is from Allāh and He gives it to whoever He wills. Allāh said, **"And do not wish for that by which Allāh has made some of you exceed others. For men is a share of what they have earned, and for women is a share of what they have earned. And ask Allāh of his bounty. Indeed Allāh is ever, of all things, Knowing."**

## Part Four: Du'a & Its Etiquettes
([see index](#an-advice-regarding-sickness--difficulty-especially-in-relation-to-magic))


All of this leads you to another pillar of a Muslim’s relationship with his or her Lord: thinking good of Allāh. Allāh The Exalted said in what the Prophet – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – narrated:

>*"I am as my slave thinks of Me."* 

So, if you think good of Allāh, you will find Allāh to be as you thought of Him. On the other hand, we are told of the punishment for those who think badly of Allāh:

>**"Those who assume about Allāh an assumption of evil nature. Upon them is a misfortune of evil nature; and Allāh has become angry with them and has cursed them and prepared for them Hell, and evil it is as a destination."**

This makes clear the foolishness of the people who say, "This is Allāh’s anger upon us" when something bad happens to them. In fact, they are joining between two major sins: thinking badly of Allāh and saying about Allāh that which they have no knowledge. Allāh says:

>**"He [shaytān] only orders you to evil and immorality and to say about Allāh what you do not know."**

Returning back to the issue of du’ā, it can be tempting to ask: ‘Why does Allāh not answer my du’ā when I call on Him?’ The Prophet said – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him:

*"The du’ā of the servant is granted as long as he does not supplicate for sin or for severing [family] relations, or he does not become impatient."* It was said, "Allāh's Messenger, what is impatience?" He said, *"That he says: I supplicated and I supplicated but I did not find it being responded to. Then, he becomes frustrated and abandons supplication."*

So, the first rule is not to be impatient. Secondly, you do not know in which way Allāh will respond to you. He may give you what you ask for quickly, or he may delay it because of His perfect wisdom. He may save you from something that was going to happen to you because of your du’ā. He may give you its reward in the hereafter. At the same time, every Muslim should fear that Allāh will not accept his deeds, and work hard to remove the things which prevent du’ā from being accepted. The Prophet – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – mentioned *"a man who has undertaken a lengthy journey and is disheveled and dusty, raising his hands towards heaven and saying, ‘O Lord!, O Lord!’ but his food is harām, his drink is harām, his clothing is harām, he is nourished with harām so how can he receive a response?"*

Ibrahim Ibn Adham - may Allāh have mercy on him - a third century scholar, a teacher and a companion of Sufyān ath-Thawree, was asked about the saying of Allāh - the Most High: **"And your Lord says, ‘Call upon Me; I will respond to you.’"** They said, "We supplicate and we are not answered." So he said to them:


>"You know Allāh, yet you do not obey Him,
You recite the Qur'ān, yet do not act according to it,
You know the shaytān, yet you have agreed with him,
You proclaim that you love Muhammad – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him, yet you abandon his sunnah,
You proclaim your love for Paradise, yet you do not act to gain it,
You proclaim your fear the Fire, yet you do not prevent yourselves from sins,
You say ‘Indeed death is true’, yet you have not prepared for it,
You point out the faults of others, yet you do not look at your faults,
You eat of that which Allāh has provided for you, yet you do not thank Him,
You bury your dead, yet you do not take a lesson from it."


Therefore, it is obligatory to be in a state between fear and hope in all of your actions. The heart of a believer is like a bird with two wings – it can’t fly without both of them, and if one of them goes too far the other one must balance it out. So if you find yourself in despair, increase your hope in Allāh. If you find yourself being lenient, increase your fear of Him. Allāh said:

>**"they supplicate their Lord in fear and hope."**

As for the head of this bird, it is the love of Allāh. Allāh said,:

**"And [yet], among the people are those who take other than Allāh as equals [to Him]. They love them as they [should] love Allāh. But those who believe are stronger in love for Allāh."**


Don’t forget that there are times and etiquettes which will help your du’ā to be answered; being in a state of wudoo’, raising your hands (in individual du’ā or du’ā for rain), making du’ā between the adhān and the iqāmah, and in the last third of the night, and in the pause between the two khutbahs in Jumu’ah. This is a long topic and I recommend referring to the tips page, [here](http://duas.com/tips.php).

## Part Five: Reliance and Medicine
([see index](#an-advice-regarding-sickness--difficulty-especially-in-relation-to-magic))


Another pillar of a Muslim’s relationship with his or her Lord is having complete trust in him. This has already been mentioned as one of the fruits of believing in qadar, but it deserves special attention. Look at the advice which the Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – gave to ibn ‘Abbās – may Allāh be pleased with them both – when he said:


>*"Young man, I shall teach you some words [of advice]: Be mindful of Allāh, and Allāh will protect you. Be mindful of Allāh, and you will find Him in front of you. If you ask, ask of Allāh; if you seek help, seek help of Allāh. Know that if the ummah were to gather together to benefit you with anything, it would only benefit you with something that Allāh had already prescribed for you, and that if they gathered together to harm you with anything, they would only harm you with something thatAllāh had already prescribed for you. The pens have been lifted and the pages have dried."*


So the Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – advised Ibn ‘Abbās the greatest of advice; the perfection of tawheed, obeying Allāh in every situation, seeking help from Allāh alone, relying upon Allāh completely and complete belief in qadar.


Reliance upon Allāh is not just one level. It is obligatory upon you that you do not seek help from anyone in something that only Allāh can give you. It is permissible, however, to seek help from people in those things that they can do. The important thing is that the less you ask those people, the closer you become to the highest level of trust and reliance upon Allāh. The more you ask people, the further away you become from trusting in Allāh. The Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said:

>*"Whoever asks someone to do ruqyah for them is free from [truly] trusting in Allāh."* 

Yet, there is no doubt that asking someone to do ruqyah is permissible, but because of what it contains in terms of relying upon someone else, and because of how easily your heart can become attached to the person reading, and because of your dependency upon them, your imān and your reliance upon Allāh is not truly complete. Husayn bin ‘Abdur-Rahman said:


>"I was once with Sa’eed bin Jubayr when he said, ‘did any of you see the shooting star last night?’ I said, ‘I did.’ Then I said, ‘I wasn’t praying because I was stung.’ He said,‘So what did you do?’ I replied, ‘I asked someone to treat me with ruqyah.’ He asked, ‘What made you do that?’ I said, ‘A hadeeth that ash-
Sha’bee related to us.’ He said, ‘What did he relate?’ I said, ‘He reported to us from Buraydah bin Al-Husayb – may Allāh be pleased with him – that the Prophet – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said, *"Ruqyah is not [completely effective] but for the evil eye or for the poisonous sting."* Sa’eed responded, ‘He does well who acts upon what he heard. But Ibn Abbās – may Allāh be pleased with them both – reported to us from the Prophet – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – that he said, ‘*The nations were displayed before me. I saw a Prophet with whom there was a small group of people, and a Prophet with whom there was only one or two people, and a Prophet with no one at all. Then a great mass appeared before me, I thought that it was my ummah. It was said to me, ‘This is Musā and his people.’ So I looked, there was another great mass. It was said to me, ‘This is your ummah. Seventy thousand of them will enter paradise without reckoning or punishment.’’* Then he stood to enter his house. The people began wondering who they might be. Some said, ‘Maybe they are the companions of Allāh’s Messenger – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him.’ Some said, ‘Maybe they are those who were born in Islam, and who never associated anything with Allāh.’ And still others were suggested. Then, Allāh’s Messenger – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – appeared before them to tell them. He said, *‘They are those who do not ask people to treat them with ruqyah, nor follow omens, nor get themselves cauterized, and upon their Lord do they trust’…"*

The Muslim who pays close attention to this hadeeth sees that the people who are mentioned are those who complete their imān and achieve true tawheed. They trust completely upon Allāh and they rely completely upon him. Allāh rewards them by entering them into Paradise without any account or any punishment, without any pain or any fear. You might say, ‘But they are only seventy thousand – how can I be from them?’ The answer is that Allāh is capable of doing anything He wants. Ask Allāh and He will give you. And there is good news! There is another wording of the narration: *"and with every one of them [the seventy thousand], there are seventy thousand more,"* so do not despair of the Mercy of Allāh. Allāh said: 

>**"Say, "O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allāh. Indeed, Allāh forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful."**


Look at the situation of the companions of the Messenger of Allāh – may Allāh be pleased with them all. Some of them gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – upon the promise that they would not ask anyone for anything. In one narration it is mentioned that one of them would fall off his camel and would not ask anyone to help him get back on. All of this was a part of their complete trust and reliance upon Allāh. Just as you find that they rarely asked the Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – to make du’ā for them, except when there was a general benefit for the ummah. We find in the narration of Ibn 'Abbās – may Allāh be pleased with them both – that he said:

>"Shall I show you a woman of the people of Paradise?...This black lady came to the Prophet and said, 'I get attacks of epilepsy and my body becomes uncovered; please make du’ā to Allāh for me.' The Prophet said (to her), *'If you wish, be patient and you will have Paradise; and if you wish, I will du’ā for Allāh to cure you.'* She said, 'I will remain patient,' and added, 'but I become uncovered, so please make du’ā to Allāh for me that I may not become uncovered.' So he made du’ā for her."


As for doing ruqyah on yourself, it doesn’t affect your trust in Allāh, because it isn’t based upon depending on someone else. The same goes if a person does ruqyah upon you without you asking first. It is authentically reported that the Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said about ruqyah:

>*"Whichever of you can help his brother, let him do so."* 

It is authentically reported that Jibreel – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – treat the Prophet – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – with ruqyah, when he was affected by magic. The same rule applies to taking medicine. The Prophet – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – explained that taking medicine is a part of relying upon Allāh, not a contradiction of it. That is because Allāh has made certain things happen because of other things. He is more than capable of curing a sick person without any medicine but He has also made medicine a reason for being cured. He said – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him:

>*"There is a cure for every disease except...death."* 

He also said:

>*"Seek the cure…"* 

However, there is a very important condition that is vital to protect your imān; you must believe with all your heart that medicine is simply something that Allāh has made a reason for people getting cured. It is not a cure in itself. The real cure only comes from Allāh. However, the Qur’ān itself is not like any other medicine. It is a cure in of itself, because it is the speech of Allāh, and one of His attributes. Finally, you must also believe that Allāh is capable of curing the sick without any medicine. Allāh says, **"When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is."**

At this point, it is important to mention that even though we strongly encourage people to try ruqyah on themselves first, we recognise that for many people, it is extremely difficult to perform ruqyah by themselves, and they need to ask for help. In this case, it is obligatory for them to ask for help, and they should not remain silent in an effort to increase their imān. This is based on the statement of Allāh, **"So ask the people of the remembrance, if you do not know."** However, it is often possible to recite by yourself, after having been shown how to recite by someone else, or by sharing the recitation between yourself and someone else. Everyone should look at their own individual situation, and Allāh knows best.


The best form of medicine is to join between Islamic medicine and modern medicine. That is because Allāh has made both of them a cause for people to be cured. There are many types of Islamic medicine; some general and some specific. From the examples of general Islamic medicine and methods of healing are:


1. The Qur’ān – Allāh said,**"And We send down of the Qur’ān that which is healing and mercy for the believers."** Notice that Allāh describes the Qur’ān as ‘healing’ not as ‘medicine’. In other words the Qur’ān goes directly to the heart of the sickness and cures it, whereas a medicine only treats the disease or its symptoms.
2. Honey – Allāh said, **"There emerges from their bellies a drink, varying in colors, in which there is healing for people. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought."** The same that is said about the Qur’ān is said about honey, even if its healing is less than the Qur’ān. That is because honey is created and the Qur’ān is the speech of Allāh; and honey is healing for sicknesses of the body and the Qur’ān is a healing for the sicknesses of the body and the heart. Even so, Allāh has described them both in a way that is more powerful than mere medicine.
3. Hijāmah (Cupping). The Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said, *"Healing is in three things: drinking honey, the incision of a cupper, and cauterizing with fire; but I forbid my ummah to use cauterization."* The same point about the word ‘healing’ as opposed to ‘medicine’ applies here. It is very important to note that hijāmah should only be done by someone who is trained in it.  Hijāmah is also very effective against the jinn and magic.
4. Zamzam water, as it is the purest and most blessed water on the earth. The Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him said: *"The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for."* Ibn-ul-Qayyim wrote in Zād-ul-Ma’ād: "Myself and others tried seeking healing with Zamzam water and saw wondrous things. I sought healing with it from a number of illnesses, and I was healed by the permission of Allāh. I saw someone who nourished himself with it for a number of days, half a month or more, and he did not feel hunger; he performed *tawāf* along with the other people just as they did. He told me that he consumed nothing but Zamzam water for forty days and he had the strength to have intercourse with his wife, to fast and to perform tawāf numerous times". Water in general is mentioned in numerous āyāt and ahādith; that it is mubārak and that it purifies and cleans you, and it is said that rain water is the best substitute for Zamzambecause Allah said, **"And We have sent down blessed rain from the sky and made grow thereby gardens and grain from the harvest"** [50:9], and because the Prophet (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) used to uncover part of his garment when it rained, and he would say, *"It has just come from its Lord."* [Muslim].


As for specific Islamic medicine, Ibn-ul-Qayyim has an entire volume of his book *Zād-ul-Ma’ād* dedicated to Islamic medicine, both general and specific. Parts of this have been summarised in the book The Medicine of the Prophet. However not all of the narrations are authentic. Therefore, it is a good idea to cross-reference it along with going back to Zād-ul- Ma’ād – see the book list at the end.

## Part Six: The Prayer
([see index](#an-advice-regarding-sickness--difficulty-especially-in-relation-to-magic))


Before going any further, it is important to mention the issue of the prayer. The Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said, *"The difference between us and them is the prayer; whoever leaves it has disbelieved."* He also said, *"between a person and between shirk and kufr is leaving the prayer."* The scholars of Islām are in agreement in two things regarding leaving the prayer; that the person who leaves it, believing that they do not have to pray, or seeing themselves above prayer is a complete disbeliever, and that the person who leaves it out of laziness or weakness of faith has committed an act of disbelief. In these two points there is no doubt and no disagreement. The disagreement is only about whether that act of disbelief from the lazy person takes the person outside of Islām or not. *Ahl-us-Sunnah* are agreed that not every action of disbelief takes a person outside of Islām, just as they are agreed that a general statement ‘whoever does such-and-such is a disbeliever’ does not mean that we single out a certain person who does that action and call them a disbeliever.


As for the ruling of the person who leaves the prayer from laziness, the opinion which is apparent from a large number of the companions – may Allāh be pleased with them all – is that the person is outside of the religion of Islām. This was the opinion of Imām Ahmad (in one narration of his) – may Allāh have mercy on him – and its proof is strong. Even those who said that the person remains a Muslim, the majority of them are of the opinion that the person is to be killed by the Muslim ruler. The point of all of this is that the person who leaves the prayer is in the most dangerous situation – if he is not a disbeliever (which appears to be the strongest opinion) then he is the closest of the people to them. Look at what the Messenger of Allāh (peace and blessings be upon him) said about the person who just misses ‘Asr prayer, *"It is as if he lost his family and his wealth."* Imagine a person who comes home to find his house burned
down and his family dead – it’s almost impossible to imagine what someone like that would be going through. Yet the one who misses the ‘Asr prayer is in a worse situation than him!

The purpose of mentioning all of this is that the Muslim remains strong upon the prayer, even in the worst of situations. There is no doubt that the person who understands the ruling of leaving the prayer is more likely to remain strong upon it – in shā' Allāh – until Allāh sends the Angel of Death to take his soul. As well as knowing the punishment, we should know the huge reward of the one who remains strong upon the prayer. The one who prays is in a constant state of awareness of his Lord – and there is no doubt that the prayer protects a person from all kinds of harm – both spiritual and physical. Allāh The Exalted said:

>**"Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing"** 

Rhe Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said:

>*"Whoever prays fajr with the jamā’ah [i.e. in the Mosque], he is under the protection of Allāh until the evening."*

He also said:

>*"If they knew what [reward] was in the fajr and ishā prayer [in jamā’ah – praying in a group in the Mosque], they would come even if they had to crawl."* 

One of the companions narrated that a sick man would "come dragging his feet between two people" just to share in this reward – even though there is no doubt that it is not obligatory for him to attend the masjid if he is so sick that he can’t walk. From these ahādith and others we can see some of the reasons why the sick person is not excused from the prayer for any reason at all – even if their body is paralysed and they can only pray with their eyelids they must do so. As for praying in jamā’ah, this only applies to the men and it is better for a Muslim woman to pray in her house – and even better for her to pray in a certain place in her own room, even though she should not be prevented from going to the masjid. The Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said:

>*"Do not prevent the female servants of Allāh from going to the mosques of Allāh, but their houses are better for them".*


***

## Part Seven: The Plots of the Shaytān
([see index](#an-advice-regarding-sickness--difficulty-especially-in-relation-to-magic))


So, how does the shaytān affect the sick? The first thing that you have to understand is the aim of the shaytān in everything he does: that you worship something else with Allāh, so that you enter Hellfire with him forever. Allāh said:

>**"[shaytān] said, ‘Because You have put me in error, I will surely sit in wait for them on Your straight path. Then I will come to them from before them and from behind them and on their right and on their left, and You will not find most of them grateful [to You].’"**

But he doesn’t stop there. If he isn’t able to get you to worship something else besides Allāh, he will try to get you to do major sins, especially innovations, because so few people repent from something that they think is good in the first place. If he can’t get you to do major sins, he will try to get you to do lots of minor sins because they pile up like the person who carried a small twig, then another, then another, until he built a fire. If he can’t get you to do that, he will try to make you busy with things that are halāl but have no reward. If he can’t get you to do that, he will try to get you to do something that is less important, or has less reward, instead of something that is more important, and has more reward. From the major aims of shaytān in this world is to separate between husband and wife in any way possible, and to a lesser extent to prevent marriage from happening in the first place. From this is that he causes arguments between them and makes them jump to conclusions about each other. The Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said:

>*"Iblees places his throne upon water; he then sends detachments (for creating dissension); the nearer to him in rank are those who are most notorious in creating dissension. One of them comes and says: I did so and so. He replies,‘You have done nothing.’ Then one amongst them comes and says, I did not spare so and so until I sowed the seed of discord between a husband and a wife.’ Satan goes near him and says, 'You have done well’...He then embraces him."*


Having said all of that, you need to learn the golden rule when it comes to the plots and plans of shaytān, whether in the form of whispering, or in the form of magic and the touch of the jinn, or in any other form. Allāh The Exalted said:

>**"Indeed, the plot of Satan has ever been weak."** 

The closer a servant of Allāh comes to Allāh the weaker the plots of shaytān are. Allāh said:

>**"But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allāh."**

Allāh also said:

>**"Secret counsel is only from shaytān that he may grieve those who have believed, but he will not harm them at all except by permission of Allāh. And upon Allāh let the believers rely."** 

And Allāh said:

>**"And they had planned their plan, but with Allāh is their plan, even if their plan had been [sufficient] to do away with the mountains."** T

here are many other āyāt with a similar meaning.


From the Mercy of Allāh to this ummah is that He has not left us without guiding us to the things that remove the shaytān, and lessen his effect. From these things are:


1. Seeking help from Allāh, relying upon Allāh and keeping as far away from sins as possible. This is part of taqwā as was mentioned.
2. Reciting the Qur’ān. For example, the shaytān does not enter the house in which Surah Al-Baqarah is read, and a person who reads Ayāt-ul-Kursee before going to sleep, Allāh sends an angel to guard them until morning. There are many other narrations that can be found in books of du’ā and manners.
3. The Adhān. It is authentically reported that the shaytān cannot stand to hear the adhān, and so he runs away and breaks wind loudly so that he can’t hear it.
4. The remembrance of Allāh. Shaytān hates it in every single way. Whether it is remembering Allāh when you enter your house, or when you eat, or in the morning and evening, or before intercourse, or when entering the bathroom; all of these things are authentically reported to keep the shaytān away. Not mentioning these du’ās leads to the shaytān coming close to you. I recommend the website [duas.com](http://duas.com) for more information.
5. Removing everything from the house that the shaytān loves. This includes pictures of humans and animals, music, films, TV, etc. This also includes charms, ta’weez (according to the correct opinion), and anything else that is kept for luck or protection. The Prophet – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said, *"Whoever hangs a charm around his neck has committed shirk."* This issue is something that is not often understood. Firstly, we must divide these charms/ta’weez into two groups:
(a) that which is done only from the Qur’ān
(b) that which contains something else.
If it contains something else then there are two situations:
(a) The person believes that the charm itself benefits them without Allāh. There is no disagreement that this is shirk and disbelief and the person has left the religion of Islām.
(b) The person believes that Allāh has made the charm a cause for his benefit but that the actual benefit comes from Allāh. This is lesser shirk which does not take the person outside of Islam but it is still from the greatest of the major sins.

The Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said:

>*"Whoever wears a charm he will be entrusted to it"* 

He also said to one of the companions:

>*"If you didn’t cut it off, you would never have been successful"* (i.e., in this world and the next).

As for that which is purely from Qur’ān, the scholars differed regarding it. The correct opinion, and the one which is reported from the companions – may Allāh be pleased with them – is that it is harām, but it does not count as shirk. What makes it even more dangerous is that I have seen and heard time after time, people who have something they think is the Qur’ān, but inside of it there are other things written between the words – this is the way of the magicians and so called ‘healers’ – may Allāh curse them all! How many people have been cured from magic when their so called ‘ta’weez’ given by their holy shaykh was cut from their neck! Allāh is the one whose help is sought. More information can be found [here](/taweez).

At this point there is something very important to mention; it could be said: ‘but I know so and so who wore a charm and they were cured’. I reply that I have no doubt about this. Remember that the number one aim of the shaytān is to make you disbelieve in Allāh. As soon as you trust in the charm you have disbelieved, or come close to disbelief, and therefore the shaytān’s work is done – he will quite happily leave. Even when being defeated, the shaytān tries the same trick. Often he will say to a person doing ruqyah, "I will leave for your sake." If that person agrees the shaytān is happy and will often leave. However, when you reply, "no you will leave for Allāh’s sake," you find him much less co-operative! This explains the Christian missionaries who remove the shaytān ‘in the name of Jesus’ and so on.
In the case of pictures, if your house contains them, no angel will enter your house and therefore your house will be a home for the shaytān – no matter what other things you do to keep him out.

## Part Eight: Magic & Magicians
([see index](#an-advice-regarding-sickness--difficulty-especially-in-relation-to-magic))

As for magic, you need to first understand its essence. Magic is a contract between the magician and the shaytān. The magician agrees to do something for the shaytān and in return the shaytān agrees to do something for the magician. This is the essence of magic. The best way to explain magic is to study Allāh’s statement:


>**"And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Sulaymān. It was not Sulaymān who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say, "We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic]." And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allāh . And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But they certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew."**


This āyah explains the foundations of magic and can be summarised briefly in five points:

1. Magic is a type of knowledge that can be learned. The proof: **"teaching people magic"**; **"And [yet] they learn from them"**
2. Magic cannot be learned without disbelieving in Allāh The Most High. In fact it cannot be learned without going to an extreme level of disbelief. The proof: **"so do not disbelieve";"would not have in the Hereafter any share"and in the next āyah:"And if they had believed and feared Allāh, then the reward from Allāh would have been [far] better, if they only knew."**
One of the scholars who works in Saudi Arabia capturing magicians told an audience that he found a magician who had repented to Allāh – and how few they are! He asked him what he had to do to learn magic. He said that his teacher told him to go to a dark, far away place. Then he sat in a circle and he was not allowed to get up for any reason. He had to make the condition that he would go to the toilet in this circle and then sleep in the same place. He said that he never prayed even a single prayer. On top of that the shaytān ordered him to disgrace the Qur’ān – the shaykh said that this takes many forms, including using the Qur’ān for toilet paper, putting it under shoes, and writing āyāt in blood – and I have seem some examples of this – may Allāh disgrace them! The shaytān did not stop there. He told this magician that he had to commit zinā with one of his mahārim (i.e., His mother, sister, aunt etc). The magician said that he could not do that but the shaytān told him it was a condition. The magician finished by saying that when he did that, he became the biggest magician in the region. This story is not something rare or unusual. Rather, this is the condition of all of the magicians; you find them covered in every kind of impurity and performing actions that even animals would not do. The more they do, the more the shaytān does for them. This also makes it clear to you how ignorant the people are who say there is such a thing as "white magic" or "good magic". Rather, every form of magic is disbelief and every magician is a disbeliever. Some people say that Imām Ash-Shāfi’ee – may Allāh have mercy on him – said that not every type of magic is disbelief. This is not true. The imām was referring to making potions and performing tricks, which are not considered as proper magic by anyone (even though they are harām because they lead to magic). In terms of proper magic he was with the rest of the ummah in declaring all magic to be disbelief.
3. Magic has a real effect on people. It is not just an illusion as some of the misguided people said. In reality magic can kill, it can make people sick, it can separate between husband and wife and it can break up families. The proof: **"And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife."**
4. No matter how strong the magic is: **"they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allāh"** and this returns you back to the principle that the plot of the shaytān is weak, no matter how strong the magic is.
5. Magic is something that harms and never benefits. The proof: **"And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them."** It harms the person who magic has been done to, it harms their families, it harms the community and it even harms the magician. It harms the soul and it harms the body. And we have heard of many magicians who were forced to do magic upon themselves to please the shaytān.


As for protection from magic; the previously mentioned points about protection from the shaytān apply and in addition to them:

1. Ruqyah. The important thing is that the effect of ruqyah is not from the recitation of the reader – it is from the speech of the Most High.
2. Eating seven dates in the morning when you wake up. The Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said that whoever does that will not be harmed by magic on that day. There is some difference of opinion about the type of date. In some opinions ‘’Ajwah dates from ‘Aaliyat-ul-Madinah’ are mentioned, in others ‘Madinah dates’ and in others ‘dates’. It seems that the best opinion is to use ‘Ajwah dates from specific area of Madinah called ‘Aaliyat-ul-Madinah.If they are not available, then any ‘Ajwah dates. If they are not available, then any Madinah dates, and if not then any dates which are available, and Allāh knows best. It is very important that when doing this the person trusts in Allāh and believes what the Messenger of Allāh said – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him.Allāh said about His Messenger,"Nor does he speak from [his own] desire. It is not but a revelation that is revealed."


There are some other issues with regard to magic.

1. You can never cure magic using magic. This is something that has become famous amongst the general population and it is the basis of many so-called ‘religious people’ who remove magic. They do so by making a counter agreement with the shaytān to remove the first magic. Anyone who Allāh has given the blessing of intelligence would realise that this is replying to disbelief with disbelief as Allāh says, "**And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them."** 
2. The ruling of watching magic, reading horoscopes, tarot cards, fortune-tellers etc. The Messenger of Allāh – may the peace and blessings of Allāh be upon him – said,*"Whoever goes to a fortune-teller and asks him about something, his prayer will not be accepted for forty days; and if he believes him then he has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad."* Therefore, the ruling is as follows; whoever watches magic (including TV), reads a horoscope, goes to a fortune-teller, even out of curiosity, but does not believe in them, their prayer is not accepted for forty days – and it is still obligatory for them to pray. If they believe or are pleased with even a single word, they have committed disbelief; if they die upon that then they die as a non-Muslim and will not ever leave the hellfire. But what about magic on TV? Magic on TV is of two types: that which is known to be done by camera tricks, and that which is doubtful or believed to be real magic. As for the second type, the ruling is the same as going to a magician. As for magic that is known to be camera tricks, watching it is harām. This is because it leads to a love of magic and may even make a person think lightly of magic, or consider learning magic in the future. The general rule is that whatever leads to something takes the same ruling as the thing which it leads to – and therefore there is no doubt that it is harām.

As for distinguishing a magician from an honest person who performs ruqyah, there are many signs – although they are not always easy to see and the best way is to avoid going to these people at all, or if you must do so, going to the people who are known for their love of the sunnah. From the signs of a magician are:
• Asking names, especially the name of the sick person’s mother
• Asking for huge amounts of money in order to cure
• Giving charms, potions, and speaking words which are not understood
• Asking for animals to be slaughtered, often in particular places
• Asking for an item of the sick person or their family, such as clothes, hair etc.
However, you must bear in mind that many magicians conceal these signs, and many of them are from the most ‘religious’ of people in their appearance. One of our teachers told us that there was a magician who used to pray five times every day in the Mosque. He used to come even before the mu’addhin. When he was caught they asked him about it and he replied that the shaytān ordered him to go and pray – but without wudoo’. In this way people are fooled into thinking these so called ‘healers’ are the friends of Allāh, when in fact they are from His greatest enemies.

This is what Allāh has made easy for me to mention. I ask Him by every one of His Names; which He named Himself, or sent down in His book, or taught any of His servants, or kept concealed in the knowledge of the unseen which is with Him, to grant us the highest level of His paradise and to allow us to enter it without any punishment or reckoning. And I ask Him by the fact that His mercy encompasses every thing, to cure us all of our sicknesses – those in our bodies and those in our hearts – and to make our path easy for us, and to give us the strength to fight against magic and the evil magicians who practice it. He is able to do all things. May peace and blessings upon our Messenger Muhammad, and upon his family and his companions and all those who follow them until the Last Day.
