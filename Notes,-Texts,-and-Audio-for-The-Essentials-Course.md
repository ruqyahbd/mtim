3. [The 40 Hadeeth of an-Nawawi](http://aa.trinimuslims.com/ilm/?book=nawawi40hadith) - Please note that this is an external link, and I have no idea how good the website itself is, or any of the content. However, the 40 hadeeth text and translation looks to be good, so I thought I would put this online for the students to benefit from.
