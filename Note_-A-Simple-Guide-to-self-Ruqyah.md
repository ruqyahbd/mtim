# A Simple Guide to self Ruqyah
<sup>Version 0.2</sup>

**Note: This article only summarizes the lecture called ‘A Simple Guide to Self Ruqyah’, the noted is collected from hereforthehereafterDOTcom site, and was not available on the Ustaz's Original Note site.**

Let’s begin.

>   
> **But he will not harm them at all except by permission of Allah.  
> And upon Allah let the believers rely.**

> **[Al-Mujadila: Ayah 10\]**

## 7 essential points
 **There are 7 essential points that form the bases of getting out of every museebah (calamity) and that comes before seeking to do Ruqyah:**

### **1. Correct your Aqeedah**

Your _Aqeedah_ refers to: **what a Muslim believes in his heart about** **the matters which are known from the Quran and the Prophetic Sunnah, in acknowledgement of the truth of Allah and His Messenger. \[2\]**

It is the belief in your heart that corrects the rest of your actions. The evidence for this has been reported in the incident below:

Nu’man b. Bashir (Allah be pleased with him) reported:

I heard Allah’s Messenger Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam as having said this (and Nu’man pointed towards his ears with his fingers):

> “What is lawful is evident and what is unlawful is evident, and in between them are the things doubtful which many people do not know. So he who guards against doubtful things keeps his religion and honour blameless, and he who indulges in doubtful things indulges in fact in unlawful things, just as a shepherd who pastures his animals round a preserve will soon pasture them in it. Beware, every king has a preserve, and the things God his declared unlawful are His preserves. **Beware, in the body there is a piece of flesh; if it is sound, the whole body is sound and if it is corrupt the whole body is corrupt, and hearken it is the heart.“**
> 
> **Reference : Sahih Muslim 1599 a  
> In-book reference : Book 22, Hadith 133**

What did Younus Alayhis Salaam do first when he was trapped in the belly of the fish and in great distress and worry? The first thing he called out was the statement of Aqeedah, the statement of Tawheed (to single out Allah in all acts of worship and to abandon the worship of anything else). Allah mentions this incident in the Quran: 

**And \[mention\] the man of the fish, when he went off in anger and thought that We would not decree \[anything\] upon him. And he called out within the** **darkness’s:**

 **لَّا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ**

**“There is no deity except You; exalted are You (free from any imperfections). Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers.”**

**So We responded to him and saved him from the distress.  
And thus do We save the believers.**  
**[Surat Al Anbiya: Ayahs 87 and 88\]**

And what did Ayub Alayhis Salaam do first when he was inflicted with serious illness and was in great distress and worry? The first thing he called out was the statement of Aqeedah, of believing in the divine attributes of Allah of His Great Mercy. Allah mentions this incident in the Quran:

**And (remember) Ayub (Job), when he cried to his Lord: “Verily, distress has seized me, and You are the Most Merciful of all those who show mercy.”**

**So We answered his call, and We removed the distress that was on him, and We restored his family to him (that he had lost), and the like thereof along with them, as a mercy from Ourselves and a Reminder for all who worship Us.  
[Surat Al Anbiya: Ayahs 83 and 84]**

And what did Zechariah Alayhis Salaam do first when he was in need of a child, a righteous heir and was in great distress and worry? The first thing he called out was the statement of Aqeedah, of believing in the divine attributes of Allah. Allah mentions this incident in the Quran:

**And [mention] Zechariah, when he called to his Lord, “My Lord, do not leave me alone [with no heir], while you are the best of inheritors.” So We answered his call, and We bestowed upon him Yahya (John), and cured his wife (to bear a child) for him. Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us.  
[Surat Al Anbiya: Ayahs 89 and 90\]**

The Ayah below summaries how important a pure, clean, doubtless Tawheed and Aqeedah is for ones security and guidance:

**It is those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah and worship none but Him Alone) and confuse not their belief with Zulm (wrong i.e. by worshipping others besides Allah), for them (only) there is security and they are the guided.  
[Surat Al An’am: Ayah 82]**

> **Allah promises you security and guidance when your Aqeedah is correct.**  

### **2. Follow the correct Sunnah of the Prophet Mohammed Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam**

If we don’t, then Allah warns us of the consequences:

**And let those who oppose the Messenger’s (Muhammad SAW) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.**  
**\[Surat An Nur: Ayah 63\]**

And if we do, then Allah Gives us glad tidings:

**Obey the Messenger – that you may receive mercy.**  
**\[Surat An Nur: Ayah 56\]**

One of the major reasons why calamities strike people is because they oppose the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam.

When you ask people of what they are doing to cure themselves with remedies from the Quran and Sunnah, they say we read this dua 109 times, this salah 87 times etc. Not a single action they are doing have any evidence for them in the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah Sallalahu Alayhi wa Sallam.

So whatever measure you take to cure yourself, whatever dua, dhikr you make, ask yourself:

> Do I have an evidence for what I am doing from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam?

What is an evidence?

Kallal Allah wa Kallal Rassul.

What Allah said and what the Prophet said.

With a saheeh isnaad or a hasan isnaad (reliable chain of narrations), or the ijmaa (consensus) of the ummah or the guidance of the companions RadhiAllahuAnhu especially those things which they agreed upon unanimously. Everything else is just an opinion.

### **3. Make sincere Tawbah**

Tim Humble says, “I have never seen cases cure faster than by doing this.”

And he says “If you only make tawbah to Allaah along with correcting the first two things of course, it will be enough insha’Allah, to bring about a cure.”

What is Tawbah?

Muhammad As-Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen writes in his book _Sifat Salaat-in-Nabee_ (pages 49-51) :

Sincere Repentance: Must meet five conditions (in order to be accepted), which are:

1.  **Sincerity to Allaah, the Most High:** This is by the person doing it only for the sake of Allaah and seeking His reward and salvation from His punishment.
2.  **Remorse:** for the sin that was committed, such that he is sad he did it and wishes he had never done it.
3.  **Ceasing:** to commit the sin immediately. If the sin was against Allaah, then he should (1) stop doing it if it was an unlawful act, or (2) hasten to do it if it was an obligation that he abandoned doing. And if the sin was against a created being (such as humans), then he should hasten to free himself from it, whether by returning it back to him or seeking his forgiveness and pardon.
4.  **Determination:** to not go back to doing that sin again in the future.
5.  **The repentance should not occur before the time when its acceptance is terminated**, either by death or by the sun rising from the west. Allaah says: “Repentance is of no effect for those who commit sins constantly until when death faces one of them, he says: Verily I repent now.” The Prophet ( _sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam_) said: “Whoever repents before the sun rises from its west, Allaah will accept his repentance.” \[Reported by Muslim\]

### 4. Taqwa

What is Taqwa?

A  famous  successor  to the companions,  Ṭalq Ibn Ḥabīb, was  asked the meaning of taqwá  to which he replied,

> “Taqwá is that you act in obedience to Allah,  hoping for his mercy, upon a light from  Allah; and taqwá is that you leave acts of  disobedience to Allah out of fear of him, upon a light from Allah.”
> 
> This narration was reported by  Ibn Abī Shaybah in “Kitāb al-Īmān” (no. 99) and al-Albānī  declared it to be authentic.

Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala says:
_So be afraid of Allah; and Allah teaches you._  
[Surat Al Baqarah: Ayah 282\]

And Allah explains how having Taqwa will help you get out of any calamity:
_And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty)._
[Surat At Talaq: Ayah 2\]

### **5. Dhikr and Du’a**

Tim Humble says: “How many go from one place of the earth to the other while if they held their hands up to Allah in sincerity, Allah would answer them?”

Tim Humble recommends buying the book _Fortress of the Muslim_ written by _Sa’id bin Ali bin Wahf Al-Qahtani_ that is full of authentic dua’s from the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam.

[Fortress of the Muslim PDF](https://www.kalamullah.com/Books/fortress_of_the_muslim.pdf)

Tim Humble recommends three dua’s to ward off a calamity by the permission of Allah from the Quran and Sunnah:

1.  Dua made by Prophet Yunus Alayhis Sallam (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when he was in the belly of the whale:
    
    **لَّا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ**
    
    “There is no deity except You; exalted are You (free from any imperfections). Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers.”  
    [Surat Al Anbiya: Ayah 87]
    
2.  Dua made by Prophet Ayyub Alayhis Sallam (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) during his affliction:
    
    **أَنِّي مَسَّنِيَ الضُّرُّ وَأَنتَ أَرْحَمُ الرَّاحِمِينَ**  
    “Verily, distress has seized me, and You are the Most Merciful of all those who show mercy.”  
    [Surat Al Anbiya: Ayah 83]
    

Dua of the Prophet Sallallaahu Alayhi was Sallam for distress:

**اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنَ الْهَمِّ ، وَالْحَزَنِ ، والْعَجْزِ ، والْكَسَلِ ، والْبُخْلِ ، والْجُبْنِ ، وضَلَعِ الدَّيْنِ ، وغَلَبَةِ الرِّجَالِ**

_allaahumma innee a‛oodhu bika minal-hammi wal-ḥazani, wal-‛ajzi wal-kasali, wal-bukhli, wal-jubni, wa ḍala‛id-dayni, wa ghalabatir-rijaal_

O Allah, I seek refuge with You from anxiety, and sorrow, and weakness, and laziness, and miserliness, and cowardice, and the burden of debts and from being over powered by men.  
[Bukhari No# 2893, 5425, 6363, 6369; Abu Dawud No# 1541; At-Tirmidhi No# 3484; An-Nasa’i No# 5449, 5450, 5453, 5476]

### **6. Patience in all its forms**

Tim Humble says that we have to show: “Patience in doing good deeds, to do the means to get out of the problem, avoiding sins, with regards to the decree of Allah.”

Allah Subhanu wa Ta’ala says:
And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient,  
Who, when afflicted with calamity, say:  
“Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.”  
Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy.  
And it is those who are the \[rightly\] guided.  
[Surat Al Baqarah: Ayahs 155-157\]

### **7. Tawakkul**

Tim Humble says, “Go and do. And then leave what you can’t control in the hands of Allah.”

Tim Humble then reminded us of the women who had epilepsy during the time of the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam:

‘Ata’ b. Abi Rabih said –

Ibn Abbas said to me: May I show you a woman of Paradise? I said: Yes. He said: Here is this dark-complexioned woman. She came to Allah’s Apostle (ﷺ) and said: I am suffering from falling sickness and I become naked; supplicate Allah for me, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Show endurance as you can do and there would be Paradise for you and, if you desire, I supplicate Allah that He may cure you. She said: I am prepared to show endurance (but the unbearable trouble is) that I become naked, so supplicate Allah that He should not let me become naked, so he supplicated for her.

Reference : Sahih Muslim 2576  
In-book reference : Book 45, Hadith 69

Her sickness was a means for her to jannah.  

All these 7 things require **knowledge** and **action**. From Surat Al Fatihah we learn that the Jews earned the wrath of Allah because they had the knowledge but they choose to do wrong and the Christians went astray because they choose to remain ignorant while thinking they were doing good. 

## More Notable 5 points

 **Now once the above 7 points have been established in your life, the following 5 points have to be implemented:**

Firstly, Tim Humble starts with the importance of salat  as a means of protection, quoting the hadith of the difference between us and the disbelievers:

Narrated Abdullah bin Buraidah narrated from his father that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “The covenant between us and them is the Salat, so whoever abandons it he has committed disbelief.”‏

Grade : Sahih (Darussalam)  
Reference : Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2621  
In-book reference : Book 40, Hadith 16

In Muslim (657) it is narrated that Jundub ibn ‘Abd-Allah said: The Messenger of Allah Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam said: “Whoever prays Fajr is under the protection of Allah, so do not fall short with regard to the rights of Allah, for anyone who does that, Allah will seize him and will throw him on his face into the Fire of Hell.”

Secondly, Tim Humble highlights the importance of reciting the prescribed Adhkaar (remembrance), from the Qur’an and Sunnah. Below are some of the very essential Adhkaar that a person must make it a habit to recite just like the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam did.

### **1. The dhikr of the morning and the evening after Fajr and Asr.**

Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala says:

**“And remember your Lord by your tongue and within yourself, humbly and with fear without loudness in words in the mornings, and in the afternoons and be not of those who are neglectful.**  
**Surely, those who are with your Lord (angels) are never too proud to perform acts of worship to Him, but they glorify His Praise and prostrate before Him”  
[Surat al-A‘raaf: Ayahs 205-206].**

It was narrated that Abaan ibn ‘Uthmaan (may Allah be pleased with him) said, narrating from ‘Uthmaan ibn ‘Affaan who said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “Whoever says **‘Bismillah illadhi la yadurru ma’a ismihi shay’un fi’l-ard wa la fi’l-sama’ wa huwa al-samee’ ul-‘aleem (In the name of Allah with Whose name nothing can harm on earth or in heaven, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing)**’, three times, will not be stricken with a sudden affliction until morning comes, and whoever says them when morning comes will not be stricken with a sudden affliction until evening comes.”

He said: Abaan ibn ‘Uthmaan was afflicted with paralysis and the man who had heard this hadith from him started looking at him. He said to him: Why are you looking at me? By Allah, I did not tell a lie about ‘Uthmaan and ‘Uthmaan did not tell a lie about the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him). But the day which that (paralysis) befell me, I got angry and forgot to say them. \[4\]

Narrated by Abu Dawood (5088). It was also narrated by at-Tirmidhi in his Sunan (no. 3388) as follows:

The Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam said, “There is no one who says in the morning of every day and the evening of every night **‘Bismillah illadhi la yadurru ma’a ismihi shay’un fi’l-ard wa la fi’l-sama’ wa huwa al-samee’ ul-‘aleem (In the name of Allah with Whose name nothing can harm on earth or in heaven, and He is the All-Hearing, All-Knowing)’**, three times but nothing will harm him.”  
At-Tirmidhi said: It is hasan saheeh ghareeb. It was classed as saheeh by Ibn al-Qayyim in Zaad al-Ma‘aad (2/338) and by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.

It is proven in Saheeh Muslim that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said:  
A man came to the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) and said: O Messenger of Allah, I was stung by a scorpion last night. He said: “If you had said, when evening came, **‘A’oodhu bi kalimaat Allaah al-taammah min sharri ma khalaq (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created)’**, it would not have harmed you.”  
Narrated by Muslim (2709).  
  
According to a report narrated by at-Tirmidhi: “Whoever says three times when evening comes, ‘**A’oodhu bi kalimaat Allaah al-taammah min sharri ma khalaq (I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created)**’, no fever will harm him that night.” No. 3604.

Another of the adhkaar that offers protection against evil and wards off harm, by Allah’s leave, is that which was narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn Khubayb (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: We went out on a rainy and very dark night, looking for the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) to lead us in prayer, and we found him. He said: “Say,” but I did not say anything. Then he said: “Say,” but I did not say anything. Then he said: “Say,” and I said: What should I say, O Messenger of Allah? He said: **“Say: Qul huwa Allaahu Ahad and al-Mu’awwidhatayn, in the evening and in the morning, three times, and they will suffice you against all things.”**  
Narrated by Abu Dawood (5082) and by at-Tirmidhi (3575), who said: It is hasan saheeh ghareeb. An-Nawawi said in al-Adhkaar (p. 107): Its isnaad is saheeh.

Al-Mu’awwidhatayn refers to the last two Surahs in the Qur’an:

* Surat Al Falaq
* Surat An Naas

### **2. The dhikr after every Salah**

Please refer to the following link of [duas.com](https://duas.com/dua/212/dua-and-remembrance-after-finishing-the-prayer-with-salaam-1)

### **3. The dhikr before you go to sleep**

‘Ali ibn Abi Taalib (may Allaah be pleased with him), who said that Faatimah (upon whom be peace) came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and asked him for a servant. He said, “Shall I not tell you of something that is better for you than that? When you go to sleep, say **‘Subhaan Allaah’ thirty-three times, ‘Al-hamdu Lillah’ thirty-three times, and ‘Allaahu akbar’ thirty four times.”** (Reported by al-Bukhaari, 4943).  
  
In the Sunnah it is recommended for the Muslim to recite certain verses when he goes to bed. \[5\]

Among the soorahs and verses which we are recommended to recite are the following:

**a) – Aayat al-Kursiy (al-Baqarah 2:255)**

It says in a mu’allaq report narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhaari (2311) that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) appointed me to guard the zakaah of Ramadaan, then someone came and started rummaging in the foodstuff … and at the end of the hadeeth he said: “When you go to your bed, recite Aayat al-Kursiy, for there will remain with you a guardian from Allah, and no devil will approach you, until morning comes.” The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “He told you the truth although he is a liar. That was a devil.”

**b) – The last two verses of Soorat al-Baqarah**

It was narrated from Abu Mas’ood al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Whoever recites the last two verses of Soorat al-Baqarah at night, they will suffice him.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5009) and Muslim (2714). Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Waabil al-Sayyib (132): They will suffice him against any evil that may harm him.

It was narrated that ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:

“I did not think that any sane person could sleep without reciting the last three verses of Soorat al-Baqarah.”

In al-Adhkaar (220), al-Nawawi attributed it to the report of Abu Bakr ibn Abi Dawood, then he said: It is saheeh according to the conditions of al-Bukhaari and Muslim.

**c) – Soorat al-Isra’ and Soorat al-Zumar**

It was narrated that ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would not go to sleep until he had recited Bani Israa’eel (Soorat al-Isra’) and al-Zumar.

Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (3402) who said: it is a hasan hadeeth. It was also classed as hasan by al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar in Nataa’ij al-Afkaar (3/65), and it was classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Tirmidhi.

**d) – Soorat al-Kaafiroon**

It was narrated that Nawfal al-Ashja’i (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to me: “Recite Qul yaa ayyuha’l-kaafiroon then go to sleep at the end of it, for it is a disavowal of shirk.”

Narrated by Abu Dawood (5055) and al-Tirmidhi (3400); classed as hasan by Ibn Hajar in Nataa’ij al-Afkaar (3/6); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.

**e) – Surat al-Ikhlaas and al-Mi’wadhatayn \[i.e., the last two  surahs of the Qur’aan\]**

It was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) went to bed every night, he would hold his hands together and blow into them, and recite into them Qul Huwa Allaahu Ahad, Qul a’oodhu bi rabb il-falaq and Qul a’oodhu bi rabb il-naas. Then he would wipe them over whatever he could of his body, starting with his head and face and the front of his body, and he would do that three times. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (5017).

It was narrated that Ibraaheem al-Nakha’i said:

They regarded it as mustahabb to recite these Surahs every night three times: Qul Huwa Allaahu Ahad and al-Mi’wadhatayn. Al-Nawawi said in al-Adhkaar (221): its isnaad is saheeh according to the conditions of Muslim.

Al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Adhkaar (221):

“It is better for a person to do all that has been narrated of this matter, but if he cannot do that he should do whatever he is able to do.”

### **4. Daily adhkaar**

There are so many adhkaar for every possible situation. Such as for entering the masjid entering and leaving the home, entering and leaving the bathroom. Again, we recommend you to download the book _‘Fortress of the Muslim’_ as mentioned earlier.

**Narrated Anas ibn Malik:**

The Prophet (ﷺ) said: When a man goes out of his house and says: “In the name of Allah, I trust in Allah; there is no might and no power but in Allah,” the following will be said to him at that time: “You are guided, defended and protected.” The devils will go far from him and another devil will say: How can you deal with a man who has been guided, defended and protected?

Grade : Sahih (Al-Albani)  
Reference : Sunan Abi Dawud 5095  
In-book reference : Book 43, Hadith 323

This above is just one example, for all these adkhaar, learn them, get them going in your life, step by step.

### **5. Protection of the house**

Tim Humble then proceeds to talk about the need to make the house a place that remembers Allah much. Some of the points he makes are:

“Make your house a fortress, protected against the shaitaan. The bigger that haraam the more the shaitaan loves that haraam. Get rid of the haram in the house: Free mixing, pictures and images of living being and animals, TV, music, movies, get it all out. Make the house a place of prayer. Men praying sunnah in the house instead of in the masjid, because that is the sunnah. Make your house a place of knowledge, where the poor are welcome, where you give a lot of sadaqah. Make the house a place where shaitaan hates to be.”

## **We now come to the actual method of ruqyah:**

Ruqyah is the treatment of sicknesses and afflictions through the recitation of the Quran, the Names of Allah and the authentic dua and adhkaar that are reported from the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam.

It can be used for any kind of sickness or affliction, anything for which you seek a cure. Whether it is psychological, physical, mental, medical, jinn, sihr, evil eye, magic, jealously. Whatever has afflicted you, ruqyah can be a cure bidhnillahi Tabaraka wa Ta’ala.

There is nothing wrong with going to someone for ruqyah because that is also from the Sunnah, but the way that is better for your imaan and your nearness to Allah and better for your cure is **self ruqhyah**.

Tim humble says that by his experience, those who get a quicker cure are those who do self treatment.

He says, “Some people will say that isn’t the intention important? Isn’t it important for me to know whats wrong with me before i start ruqyah. Some of my colleagues have said this. May Allah protect them.

However I have done some research on this issue and I feel confident in saying that at least in the early days you can do a general intention for a cure and insha’Allah that will benefit you and when you know what it is then you can become more specific insha’Allah. The evidence for this is that the dua the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam used for ruqyah was general for eg:

Narrated \`Aisha:

The Prophet (ﷺ) used to treat some of his wives by passing his right hand over the place of ailment and used to say, **“O Allah, the Lord of the people! Remove the trouble and heal the patient, for You are the Healer. No healing is of any avail but Yours; healing that will leave behind no ailment.”**

حَدَّثَنَا عَمْرُو بْنُ عَلِيٍّ، حَدَّثَنَا يَحْيَى، حَدَّثَنَا سُفْيَانُ، حَدَّثَنِي سُلَيْمَانُ، عَنْ مُسْلِمٍ، عَنْ مَسْرُوقٍ، عَنْ عَائِشَةَ ـ رضى الله عنها ـ أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم كَانَ يُعَوِّذُ بَعْضَ أَهْلِهِ، يَمْسَحُ بِيَدِهِ الْيُمْنَى وَيَقُولُ ‏ “‏ **اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ النَّاسِ أَذْهِبِ الْبَاسَ، اشْفِهِ وَأَنْتَ الشَّافِي، لاَ شِفَاءَ إِلاَّ شِفَاؤُكَ، شِفَاءً لاَ يُغَادِرُ سَقَمًا ‏”****‏‏.**‏ قَالَ سُفْيَانُ حَدَّثْتُ بِهِ مَنْصُورًا فَحَدَّثَنِي عَنْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ عَنْ مَسْرُوقٍ عَنْ عَائِشَةَ نَحْوَهُ‏.‏

Reference : Sahih al-Bukhari 5743  
In-book reference : Book 76, Hadith 58

And in some duas the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam combined between multiple things:

Abu Sa’id reported that Gabriel came to Allah’s Messenger (ﷺ) and said:

Muhammad, have you fallen ill? Thereupon he said: Yes. He (Gabriel) said: **“In the name of Allah I exorcise you from everything and safeguard you from every evil that may harm you and from the eye of a jealous one. Allah would cure you and I invoke the name of Allah for you.”**

حَدَّثَنَا بِشْرُ بْنُ هِلاَلٍ الصَّوَّافُ، حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ الْوَارِثِ، حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ الْعَزِيزِ بْنُ صُهَيْبٍ، عَنْ أَبِي نَضْرَةَ، عَنْ أَبِي سَعِيدٍ، أَنَّ جِبْرِيلَ، أَتَى النَّبِيَّ صلى الله عليه وسلم فَقَالَ يَا مُحَمَّدُ اشْتَكَيْتَ فَقَالَ ‏ “‏ نَعَمْ ‏”‏ ‏.‏ قَالَ **بِاسْمِ اللَّهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ يُؤْذِيكَ مِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ أَوْ عَيْنِ حَاسِدٍ اللَّهُ يَشْفِيكَ بِاسْمِ اللَّهِ أَرْقِيكَ** ‏.‏

In-book reference : Book 39, Hadith 54

**The treatment has various preconditions:**

1.  You direct all worship to Allah alone without giving the rights of Allah to anyone or anything else.
2.  Trusting Allah completely and recognising that there is no cure except from Allah. If you believe you will get a cure from Mohammed Tim, I can promise you that you will not get a cure.
3.  Again, strictly following the Sunnah.
4.  You are not in possession of a Tahweez.  
    Ibn Mas’ud said, “The Tahweez are haraam from the Quran and from anything other than the Quran.”  
    Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala says, “And they followed \[instead\] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say, “We are a trial, so do not disbelieve \[by practicing magic\].” And \[yet\] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah . And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But the Children of Israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew.” \[Quran 2:102\]

5.  You are praying your 5 daily prayers

**The next thing is to prepare the environment to do ruqyah in:**

Tim Humble says,

“It is most likely the person will try to harm themselves. Rarely will they harm you. Make sure there is nothing in the environment that allows him or her to do that. Lock the doors, keeps knives or objects of any kind far away from reach etc.

It is best practise to do ruqyah with a partner who can monitor the situation.

NOTE: Cases where the patient reacts in a crazy manner to cause harm to himself are very very rare.

I want to be clear that ruqyah means _reciting_ the Quran and not _playing some audio_.

You can use ruqyah audio to supplement your ruqyah, **but it does not count as ruqyah**. Do it as a supplement, as a bonus.”

## **Steps to perform ruqyah**

1. Purify your intention

2. Ask Allah Subhana hu wa Ta’ala for his aid.

3. Begin by saying:

**أعوذ بالله من الشيطان الرجيم بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيم**

4. Every single day, a minimum of 45 minutes, by Tim’s experience, continue reading:

a) Surat Al Fatihah

Either one time. Or 3 times. Or 7 times. Or a random number of times not aiming for a fixed number.

b) Ayat ul Kursi

c)  Kulya Ayyu Hal Kafiroon

d) Kul huwallahu Ahad

e) Kul aaudhu birabbil falaq

f) Kul aaudhu birabbi-naas

g)

 **“‏ اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ النَّاسِ أَذْهِبِ الْبَاسَ، اشْفِهِ وَأَنْتَ الشَّافِي، لاَ شِفَاءَ إِلاَّ شِفَاؤُكَ، شِفَاءً لاَ يُغَادِرُ سَقَمًا ‏”**

_Allahuma rabbi-nas adhhabal ba’sa, ashfi wa anta al-shafi,_  
_la shifa’ illa shifa’uka shifa’ la yughadiru saqama._

At-Tirmidhi said: It is hasan saheeh ghareeb. It was classed as saheeh by Ibn al-Qayyim in Zaad al-Ma‘aad (2/338) and by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.

j)

 **” أعوذ بكلمات الله التامات من شر ما خلق “**

_‘A’oodhu bi kalimaat Allaah al-taammah min sharri ma khalaq_

_I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of that which He has created._

Narrated by Muslim (2709)

k)

It is related that Ibn ‘Abbas said, “The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to seek refuge for al-Hasan and al-Husayn (when they were small). He said, Your fore father (Ibraheem A.S) used to seek refuge – with it for Isma’il and Ishaq, and this is the dua the prophet s.a.w recited for them:

 **” أَعُوذُ بِكَلِمَاتِ اللَّهِ التَّامَّةِ مِنْ كُلِّ شَيْطَانٍ وَهَامَّةٍ وَمِنْ كُلِّ عَيْنٍ لَامَّةٍ “**

_Aoodhu bi kalimaat-illaahit taammati min kulli shaytaanin wa haammatin wa min kulli ‘aynin laammah_

_I seek refuge with the perfect words of Allah from every Shaytan and poisonous insect and from every envious eye._

[Ref: Narrated by Al Bukhari – Hadith no. 3191\]

l)
  
**أَعُوذُ بِكَلِمَاتِ اللهِ التَّامَّةِ مِنْ غَضَبِهِ، وَعِقَابِهِ، وَشَرِّ عِبَادِهِ، وَمِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيَاطِينِ، وَأَنْ يَحْضُرُونِ**

_Audhu bi kalimati’ llahi’t-tammati min ghadabihi wa iqabihi wa sharri ibadihi wa min hamazati’ sh-shayatin wa an yahdurun_

_I seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from His wrath and punishment, from the evil of His slaves and from the evil promptings of the devils and from their presence._

[Muwatta Maalik, Book 51, Hadith 9\]

m)

 **” بِاسْمِ اللهِ يُبْرِيكَ وَمِنْ كُلِّ دَاءٍ يَشْفِيكَ وَمِنْ شَرِّ حَاسِدٍ إِذَا حَسَدَ وَمِنْ شَرِّ كُلِّ ذِي عَيْنٍ **“**

_Bismillahi yubreeka wa min kulli daa’in yashfeeka wa min sharri haasidin iza hasad wa min sharri kulli zhi-‘ayn_

_In the name of Allah, may He cure you from all kinds of illnesses and safeguard you from the evil of a jealous one when he feels jealous and from everyone with the evil eye._ 

[Sahih Muslim, Book 26, 5424\]

n)

 **” أَسْـأَلُ اللهَ العَـظيـم، رَبَّ العَـرْشِ العَـظيـم أَنْ يَشْفِيَكَ “**

_‘As’alullaahal-‘Adheema Rabbal-‘Arshil-‘Adheemi ‘an yashfiyaka  
(Recite 7 times)_

_I ask Almighty Allah, Lord of the Magnificent Throne, to make you well._

\[At-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud. See also Al-Albani, Sahih At-Tirmidhi 2/210\]

o)

 **(بِسْمِ اللهِ ” (ثلاث مرات “**

**(أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ وَقُدْرَتِهِ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا أَجِدُ وَأُحَاذِرُ ” (سبع مرات “**

_Bis-mil-laah (3 Times)_

_’A‛oodhu bial-laahi wa qudratih min shar-ri maa ajidu wa uḥaadhir (7 Times)_

_Place your hand at the site of the pain and say:_

_“In the name of Allah.” (three times)_

_…then supplicate:_

_“I seek refuge with Allah and His omnipotence from the evil of what I feel and that which I am wary of.” (Seven times)_

Make sure you are making the following changes depending on who you are reading the above dua’s for, this basically means ‘I seek refuge from Allah for you’:

For yourself: أَعُوذُ
For one man: أُعِيذُكَ
For one woman: أُعِيذُكِ
For a group: أُعِيدُكُمْ

If you like you can repeat an Ayah. Like some of the scholars used to do.

Whenever you wish you may blow. With or without spittle. You may blow in your hands and put them on the person.

You may blow in your hands and put them on the person. You may read while holding the person. You may read into the persons ear. You may read and blow after every Ayah. After every Surah. Or every page. Whatever the Sunnah allows.

**What if there is a non Mahram, then how can you touch?**

1.  You will need the presence of a Mahram. If not available, then at least the presence of another sister. All physical contact should not be done by you.
2.  You are further than arm’s length away from her. So you can’t get touchy feely by accident and for safety.
3.  Recite from behind her head so you don’t have to worry about lowering your gaze. Note that she is obviously in her proper full hijab.

Coming back to Mahram, there is no harm in you touching but remember to:

*   Touch feel what’s going on
*   Keep an eye for what’s going on
*   Listen to what’s going on
*   DO NOT HIT CAUSE YOU DON’T KNOW HOW-Although it’s allowed.

If you see some movement in the body, e.g. arm starts to move, just focus your blowing, focus your rubbing in that area.

NOTE: If there are other specific Ayat related to the sickness \[6\] , you are welcome to recite any Ayat that you wish. **But after the 45 minutes.**

**Why?**

Tim says, “Because I fear for you something that I fell in for a while, I would be reading Surat Saffat instead of Falaq and Naas which were REVEALED to treat these problems. And i would run out of time and realise i didn’t read the quls.”

If you have more than 45 minutes you can also recite Surat Al Baqarah.

“It is one of the most important tools against magic and the magicians. You can break it up but what is recommend is to finish as much as you can in one go.”

The Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam told us that its recitation in a house keeps the Satan away:

Abu Hurayrah reports that the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.) said: “Do not make your houses like graves, for the Shaytan runs away from a house in which Surat al-Baqarah is recited.”

[Narrated by Muslim, 780]

If depends upon the seriousness of the situation. If it’s really serious than finish reciting the entire Surah along with your 45 minutes.

You may also keep a bottle of good quality olive oil, and regularly blow into the oil as you are reading. This can also be done with water, preferably zamzam.

You can use them during or later on in the treatment.

You generally rub the olive oil and and the water you either spray or drink.

On Islamqa.info it says:

He may also recite the above into water, some of which should be drunk by the person who has been affected by sihr, and he should wash with the rest, one or more times as needed. This will remove the sihr by Allah’s leave. This was mentioned by the scholars (may Allah have mercy on them), and by Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahman ibn Hasan (may Allah have mercy on him) in Fath al-Majeed Sharh Kitab al-Tawheed, in (the chapter entitled) Bab Ma ja a fi’l-Nushrah, and by others. [6]

There are healing benefits in oil, black seeds and honey.

About oil, the Messenger Sallallaahu alayhi Wasallam said:

“Eat olive oil and anoint yourselves with it, for it is from a blessed tree.”

[Tirmidhi At’ima, 43]

  
“Eat olive oil with your bread, and oil yourselves with it, for it is from a blessed tree.”

[Ibn Maja, At’ima, 34]

“Eat the oil and use it on your hair and skin, for it comes from a blessed tree.”

[Reported by al-Tirmidhi, 1775; see also Saheeh al-Jaami]

About Black seeds, the Messenger Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam said:

“In it there is healing for every disease, except as-saam.” Ibn Shihaab said: As-saam is death.

[Al-Bukhaari (5688) and Muslim (2215)]

About honey, Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’la has said:

“And your Lord inspired the bees, saying: “Take you habitations in the mountains and in the trees and in what they erect. (68) “Then, eat of all fruits, and follow the ways of your Lord made easy (for you).” There comes forth from their bellies, **a drink of varying colour wherein is healing for men**. Verily, in this is indeed a sign for people who think”

[Surat al-Nahl : Ayahs 68-69]

Abu Sa’id al-Khudri reported: A man came to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and he said, “My brother has diarrhea.” The Prophet said, “**Give him honey to drink**.” The man gave him honey to drink and he said, “I gave it to him but his diarrhea only got worse.” The Prophet said, “Allah told the truth and your brother’s stomach is mistaken.” He gave him more honey and get got better.

**Now the next question is this:**

What might happen after the 45 minutes session above is implemented?

Tim Humble says, “In the vast majority of cases 60 to 70% nothing might happen. But do NOT stop at least for a month. Because so many times the problem takes time to come up.”

If it’s medical, go to the doctor AND do ruqyah. As long as you don’t feel well continue doing ruqyah. Even if the Ruqyah made you feel better on the first day, continue the Ruqyah for one month.

If people start to get **mild** reactions, like they don’t start feeling well, their finger or mouth twists or they don’t feel well,manage it kindly with more ruqyah and water.

If it’s **severe,** if the jinn manifests itself and starts speaking, very kindly tell them to leave and that you are not there to harm him, don’t create pacts, or oaths. Give a little dawah. Don’t listen to their stories. Stay on message, nicely and simply tell them to leave, invite them to the religion of Islam. Tell them I’m asking you in the Name of Allah to leave and if you leave no harm will come to you. But if you don’t I will continue reading. Simple. Don’t go into a conversation. Stick to the message.

Now for the **violent** reaction. Very rare where the person kicks or beats. Your first concern is their safety not yours. Don’t run out of the room. Safely restrain them proactively. Meaning before they start hurting themselves restrain them. Put some gentle pressure on the shoulders.

Tim says, “One of the rare cases I would touch a women who is non mahram is when the Mahram cannot handle it and the women is hurting herself. Focus on the recitation to weaken them not your strength. That’s why you have a partner, and you are mashing them weak by the permission of Allah through the recitation.”

Another way of healing practised by the Prophet Mohammed Sallallahu Alayhi wa Sallam was hijamah, please read in full here: [https://islamqa.info/en/3268](https://islamqa.info/en/3268)

Tim Humble says about hijamah, “It’s more useful towards the end of the ruqyah when the problem is almost gone.”

**Don’t worry if it takes too long**

Tim Humble says “It is because Allah wants to test your iman as He promised He would do in the Quran.”

**And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient,  
Who, when afflicted with calamity, say:  “Truly! To Allah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.” 
Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy. And it is those who are the [rightly] guided.  
[Surat Al Baqarah: Ayahs 155-157]**
